I'll be your host",66,"today.",61,"So on this",67,"podcast",66,"will be bringing",62,"in the experts.",111,"NASA scientists,",109,"engineers,",63,"astronauts.",69,"Pretty much all",69,"the folks that",59,"have the coolest",62,"information,",61,"the stuff you",60,"really want",54,"to know right",102,"on the show",52,"and tell you more",60,"about all",54,"things.",32,"NASA, we're",99,"talking everything",72,"from extraterrestrial",100,"dirt to the",60,"unknown parts",66,"of the universe.",115,"So today,",60,"on the first",55,"episode ever,",69,"we're talking",63,"International",67,"Space Station",68,"with Dan Hewitt.",78,"He's",64,"the Public Affairs",74,"Officer for",55,"the space station",74,"program here",76,"at the Nasa",57,"Johnson Space",72,"Center in Houston,",78,"Texas.",77,"And we had a great",73,"discussion",52,"about what the",50,"International",56,"Space Station",60,"is, how",77,"it works,",51,"what it's made",52,"of and",61,"why is there?",130,"So with no further",71,"delay, let's",61,"go light",52,"speed and jump",68,"right ahead to",59,"our talk with",59,"Mr Dan",74,"Hewitt.",59,-1,0,"Enjoy",884,"T -5",85,"seconds and",61,"counting Mark.",821,-1,0,"Have a podcast.",515,-1,0,"That's true.",54,"Very true.",124,"So",56,"anyway, let's",73,"uh let's begin.",86,"I figured you're",68,"the perfect person",72,"to have here",52,"being the Public",65,"Affairs Officer",83,"of the International",88,"Space Station,",57,"you talk to scientists,",113,"astronauts,",74,"engineers",107,"constantly.",74,"So you're",80,"very aware",68,"of what's going",58,"on and",75,"everything about",60,"the space station.",75,"So for",129,"those of you listening,",95,"I think this is a",53,"good opportunity",71,"to learn just",73,"everything about",58,"it, right?",51,"So",56,"start from the",53,"very beginning.",78,"What is",74,"it, everything",110,"awesome",112,"to start",104,"in the beginning",78,"now.",58,-1,0,"So",59,"the space station",83,"is, it's a giant",77,"spaceship.",90,"I mean, it is,",79,"it is the largest",96,"spacecraft",89,"that humans",57,"have ever",61,"built.",81,"And",76,"we haven't been flying",81,"in space for",63,"too long,",94,"relatively.",130,"I mean, we've been",63,"up there for",50,"50 or 60",79,"years,",52,"but the space",79,"station is",85,"kind of the",56,"pinnacle",51,"for what we've built",73,"so far.",46,"It is massive.",136,"I mean, this",51,"thing supports",118,"multiple",50,"people.",61,"It's been up",67,"there at least",59,"pieces of",57,"it since 1998.",169,-1,0,"So that's",74,"another",99,"one of those factoid",96,"alerts that we",56,"always like to tell",69,"people",102,"if you were",60,"born",94,"After",90,"the year 1998,",126,"the spacecraft",67,"always been out there.",62,"But if you were",55,"born after",71,"the year",75,"after November",88,"of 2000,",122,"as long",53,"as you've been alive,",121,"human",57,"beings have been",63,"living and working",84,"in space.",102,-1,0,"We",70,"are aliens.",100,"We are a",50,"space",55,"faring",58,"species.",84,"We are the ones",77,"off the planet.",104,"We've had",55,"people up there",55,"every single",84,"day",72,"for",81,"as of right",56,"now.",21,"Over 16",61,"years.",29,"I mean, that is",52,"mind blowing",125,"and they're",59,"doing stuff",90,"every single",57,"day.",111,-1,0,"It's either",58,"going to impact",64,"us here on earth",92,"or get",66,"us ready to go",58,"further out.",76,"I mean, that is",61,"the purpose",75,"of the space",63,"station.",34,"That's why",75,"it's up there.",73,"That's why we",58,"have this huge",103,"thing",53,"floating",75,"above us.",68,"So you say",61,"stuff",73,"we're doing stuff",96,"every day, obviously",83,"living up there",62,"I think is like,",66,"is a big",57,"part of it, right?",64,"Where we're, like",89,"you said, we're explorers,",87,"we're spacefarers.",84,"What is",60,"the stuff",66,"that actually,",91,"you know, that",62,"has that impact?",81,"It's a lot of",52,"stuff.",47,"It's a lot of",53,"stuff",58,"and I mean, it is,",67,"it is,",87,"and it's divided",87,"up.",21,"It is",57,"as simple",69,"as just",104,"living in",50,"space.",36,"So just everything",68,"you do in space",92,"is a little bit",55,"different",72,"than the",55,"way you do",53,"it down here",69,"on earth.",89,"I mean, it could",55,"be anything",51,"from going to the",56,"bathroom to how",60,"you eat too,",71,"just how",53,"you get your",56,"water.",46,"Everything's",56,"different.",105,-1,0,"So, it's like a",53,"way to practice",72,"really for,",53,"for",77,"things",69,"further out",70,"because it's",51,"not really far",64,"up.",19,"Right.",18,"It's only 250",103,"miles.",28,"If you think about it,",50,"we're still",51,"in the",55,"earth's protection.",101,"Like",59,"you're still protected",76,"by the earth's magnetic",76,"field.",30,"Well,",68,"space",86,"is funny and",62,"that going,",103,"it",65,"feels like it's",56,"so far",92,"away space,",98,"but it's",52,"250",70,"miles.",36,"That's not",59,"that far.",120,"I mean, I",61,"feel like",71,"the city",66,"of Houston",50,"is 250",61,"miles.",35,"It's not",64,"but, I",85,"mean, 250",91,"miles in a car",89,"is a,",52,"is a",52,"short road",59,"trip,",52,"but 250",106,"miles straight",63,"up, that's a rocket",81,"ride.",28,"That's, it's a",54,"slightly different",78,"road trip,",82,"but it is,",64,"it isn't that",76,"far away.",86,"I mean, we still",66,"kind of are",76,"right on the",59,"doorstep.",90,"There's",106,"there's a",107,"really great",80,"quote",55,"in,",58,"uh,",103,"the,",216,"the",53,"Paramount of",55,"Space movies.",66,-1,0,"Armageddon",70,"where Owen Wilson",80,"says, you",84,"know, we're not even",59,"out in",63,"outer space",69,"yet.",23,"This is just",51,"like the beginning",93,"and that's",54,"kind of where the",59,"station is.",79,"It's, it's",56,"in space,",75,"it's in what we",56,"call low",52,"earth orbit.",88,-1,0,"So it's still pretty",70,"close.",56,"I mean, they could",86,"get into",70,"so",62,"you spacecraft",76,"and be back on",58,"the ground",79,"inside a",81,"couple of hours.",96,"So,",67,"I mean, you're still",60,"right on the doorstep.",95,"You're not really",68,"way out",67,"there yet, but",123,"it's getting",50,"us ready",61,"to go way",53,"out there.",61,"Well, that's",52,"the whole, so",73,"NASA describes",95,"it as earth",54,"reliant,",65,"right?",36,"So I",58,"kind of like the way",53,"they sectioned it",55,"off, right.",39,"Earth reliant",79,"means",56,"exactly",57,"what you said.",45,"Right.",16,"So if something goes",63,"wrong,",62,"you",53,"can just",61,"hop in a spacecraft",81,"and be home in three",83,"hours",73,"and",105,"it's easy",104,"to get stuff",77,"there because it's",59,"only uh",67,"I mean, some",50,"soyuz rise",60,"have been as little",54,"as like six",53,"hours, right?",60,"Relatively",127,"go",73,"into space",88,"rockets.",59,"I don't want to trivialize",122,"it still.",77,"And even",57,"that you're",94,"gonna have to admonish",86,"myself.",44,"It's still not, it's",55,"easy",52,"to go to space.",88,-1,0,"It's still, I mean,",60,"it is rocket",69,"science, it's",57,"literal.",45,"Rocket science,",80,"which is hugely",127,"complex",85,"and there's",74,"always inherent",92,"risk and all",51,"these other things.",99,"But when",53,"you start comparing",99,"it to,",74,"you",72,"know, going",50,"to Mars",67,"or, you",103,"know, our far",81,"flung aspirations",121,"of spreading",101,"throughout the",104,"solar system",72,"and the galaxy",83,"and everything.",85,"When",53,"you compare it",57,"to that,",59,"it's, you",72,"know, doing",92,"hand quotes",61,"easy, but",158,"it's still a",55,"monumental",101,"undertaking",153,"and that's why.",91,"So we're",54,"doing that",55,"just like you said,",85,"uh in",83,"the future where",57,"we wanna go farther,",86,"right?",28,"So we want to go to",54,"Mars, we want",63,"to really",80,"just expand",87,"our presence in",58,"the solar system.",72,"So",59,"the International",82,"Space Station",84,"is a",57,"great way",71,"to practice",70,"that.",45,"It's a good,",69,"like you have",71,"a good understanding",74,"of what it takes",68,"to live",53,"in space",62,"to operate",87,"in space.",48,-1,0,"You could do a ton",81,"of science",67,"and learn",52,"how things",65,"interact.",68,"And then if",68,"you learn how things",72,"interact, you",54,"can design",85,"better systems",106,"to make them",54,"work better.",70,"I think one",58,"of the ones",55,"I",52,"think capillary",81,"action I think",56,"was, was",56,"a great",53,"one.",36,"Like the way that",61,"fluids move",85,"in um",81,"in space",65,"is kind of cool",69,"because",70,"they sort",68,"of like create",59,"a ball",54,"and there's, there's",50,"no down.",70,"So if",73,"you're trying to design",91,"like a system",88,"that",63,"uh",107,"like a rocket",76,"system in",52,"order to propel",67,"fuel, you",63,"need to, the",81,"fuel isn't",58,"gonna go down.",106,"Right.",41,"It kind of needs",68,"to have that",55,"sort of capillary",82,"action and",52,"a",56,"path to get",72,"there.",24,"Like little,",59,"those",60,"little tiny",62,"things or things",74,"that make the huge",72,"difference in",72,"being able",54,"to kind of explore",73,"the solar system.",61,"Well, it all comes",76,"to down",68,"to gravity",93,"and that's",60,"kind of the",91,"ultimate",57,"differentiator",89,"between why",64,"everything we",60,"do in outer",65,"space",51,"is different",72,"from the way we do",65,"it on earth.",81,-1,0,"Some of the stuff",57,"you touch on",61,"is, is",130,"very",114,"apt, I mean,",78,"just moving",109,"fluids",96,"where,",163,"you know, here",71,"on earth, we almost",64,"take it for granted",69,"that everything settles",86,"towards the bottom.",76,"So plumbing",72,"systems and",58,"everything you",61,"can use",56,"that to your",55,"advantage",50,"in space, you",56,"don't have that",79,"and that affects",78,"everything",56,"from moving",98,"rocket fuel",74,"to,",56,"you",72,"know, I'm an astronaut",88,"and I need to get",52,"a drink of water.",89,"Well,",75,"that",76,"system",57,"has to be specifically",158,"designed",66,"to work",64,"in the absence",72,"of gravity.",79,"And we've",56,"had a lot of practice,",135,"you know, since",80,"we've been flying",78,"in space",67,"since, since",87,"the sixties,",120,"but the",50,"station",97,"is really the",57,"first place",77,"you've had",208,"on this",58,"scale.",51,"There have been space",61,"stations in the",56,"past,",51,"both from the",56,"US and",76,"Russia,",88,"but the",59,"space station",72,"is really",95,"the",88,"modern",112,"cutting",58,"edge",76,"testbed",89,"for just",88,"doing",64,"and learning",78,"everything",65,"about living",102,"in space.",117,-1,0,"And",53,"so you have",80,"all of these",53,"different technologies",133,"that",92,"like I said earlier,",83,"everything",58,"you do in",65,"space is",53,"different from",52,"the way that",51,"you do it on,",59,"on",56,"Plan Earth",66,"where you",80,"know, you have",97,"oxygen",90,"thanks to",78,"natural",73,"cycles",118,"and you have trees",90,"scrubbing carbon",70,"dioxide",65,"from your atmosphere",107,"and producing",112,"oxygen back",86,"for you.",53,"You have water",108,"and lakes",120,"reservoirs",92,"coming literally",86,"raining down",59,"on you from the",51,"sky",51,"where in",62,"space,",72,"none",65,"of that exists,",169,"you",110,"either have to",52,"bring it with",54,"you or",71,"find a way",50,"to create",58,"it.",49,"And that's",70,"something that we're",57,"doing on the",51,"station right",67,"now where",71,"you're trying",55,"to.",32,"And that's",63,"one of those key.",194,-1,0,"We",50,"always talk about",59,"the different technologies",116,"that you need.",95,"And technology",70,"is a really broad",85,"term.",60,"But",94,"one of the ones",76,"that",74,"is a lot,",98,"probably",61,"easier to",57,"understand",75,"is how",102,"we get those",93,"things,",64,"how you get",56,"the water,",64,"how you get the",72,"air",72,"just",53,"for the crew",53,"members.",64,"And",90,"one",75,"of the things",50,"you got to remember",81,"is again,",56,"so we're",104,"close to earth",58,"right now.",55,"So we can",55,"launch water,",92,"we can launch",101,"air,",58,"we can launch",53,"all these things",60,"to these crew",52,"members.",64,"But",74,"when they go to Mars,",123,"there's no",61,"resupply",59,"ship,",55,"there's no,",85,"you know, hey,",114,"the water",51,"tanks get",54,"low, let's",65,"let's, you know,",59,"stop off",57,"here and tap",80,"it off.",67,"You can't",56,"do that.",76,"So you gotta",57,"bring everything",139,"with you",104,"and everything",106,"is heavy.",87,-1,0,"So",98,"the more stuff",82,"you bring with",52,"you, the more fuel",69,"you need, the more",57,"expensive your",53,"mission and it",69,"just kind",50,"of compounds",77,"on and on and",59,"on and on.",104,-1,0,"And I'm gonna ramble",76,"here for a while",57,"because I love",69,"this subject.",65,"Okay.",23,"Well, I'll",83,"kind of,",60,"I'm not going to",53,"stop you.",45,"I'm gonna kind",70,"of like",62,"re divert you",81,"one",98,"of the things on",51,"the International",59,"Space Station",57,"they're doing",63,"now",54,"to do.",48,"Exactly that.",63,"So you",50,"said things are heavy,",85,"right?",29,"Water,",54,"water",63,"especially",57,"is very",50,"heavy.",56,"I forget",55,"the cost",58,"per pound",75,"to order",57,"in order to launch,",178,"but always",65,"okay.",37,"That's good to know.",103,-1,0,"But I",51,"know",57,"like",58,"one way they're",55,"actually",50,"doing",97,"like helping",51,"that out for",61,"long duration",60,"missions",51,"is recycling",116,"and the recycling",89,"system is",61,"just top notch",87,"so good",66,"that they actually",67,"brought the technology",82,"back down",51,"to earth",71,"and then actually",72,"helping out third",62,"world countries",77,"with, you",57,"know, not",67,"access",65,"to any kind",57,"of clean",52,"drinking water.",79,"It's",53,"like the filtration",96,"system.",29,"Is that good?",65,"They drink",63,"their own",55,"urine and",74,"capture",64,"sweat and",52,"stuff like that,",56,"right?",59,-1,0,"They do.",65,"And that's,",59,"that's always",55,"a",73,"fun",53,"ill moment",92,"for little kids",75,"and stuff when",53,"you tell them that.",74,"But and",54,"there's, there's",66,"the famous",54,"astronaut saying",80,"that yesterday's",114,"coffee is",57,"tomorrow's",57,"coffee",75,"to where",113,"that's what",61,"you have to do",75,"when you have",53,"these weight limits",87,"and you're in this",62,"environment",61,"where, you",68,"know, outside",71,"your four metal",73,"walls",53,"is just a vacuum",87,"of nothingness.",114,"You",61,"have to find",80,"ways to conserve",93,"all those things.",68,"And we know",69,"very well",89,"here on planet",65,"Earth that conservation",160,"is a",51,"very important",130,"facet",67,"of life.",63,"We try to do",64,"it through recycling",96,"and any",55,"number of things,",88,"it's",51,"10 times",68,"more important",60,"when you're in space",74,"and there is",62,"no,",52,"you know,",52,"corner store",88,"that you can run",64,"to and,",51,"you know, pick up",51,"some water.",55,"So the only",71,"things you have",90,"are the things you bring",65,"with you.",59,-1,0,"And so",53,"to recycle",54,"the water, they",66,"actually, and they",58,"do, they collect",124,"water",73,"from all",58,"different sources,",82,"whether it's",135,"The astronauts",86,"urine,",55,"which is a major",77,"source,",52,"their sweat",81,"condensation",91,"in the cabin,",79,"any kind",65,"of wastewater",116,"gets",69,"fed through",71,"a treatment",62,"system",67,"which,",80,"you",59,"know, purifies",78,"the water and",52,"then puts it",56,"back out on",57,"the other side",86,"for them to",87,"continue",55,"to reuse.",79,"And",67,"the",109,"percentages",69,"seem to vary.",65,"But I mean,

you alluded",66,"to, we've actually",79,"taken that",98,"water",89,"recycling",78,"technology",63,"and made it available",115,"and it's",63,"been used",112,"in",136,"uh disadvantaged",110,"areas of the",52,"world that don't",70,"have access to",62,"clean drinking",68,"water.",52,"And so",53,"that's just",64,"a great",74,"example",58,"of here's",99,"the technology",76,"that we need",56,"for outer space.",117,"You",70,"know, we're trying to",57,"solve a problem",122,"off",52,"this world",88,"where we have",66,"the problem.",61,"And then we",74,"find",62,"a completely",80,"different",51,"use for this",56,"technology",102,"that it wasn't",66,"necessarily",63,"designed for.",59,"I mean, our scientists",74,"didn't set out",62,"to develop",108,"a water",57,"filtration",59,"system for",67,"places without",72,"clean drinking",80,"water on earth,",103,"but it ended",57,"up having",75,"a use there",111,"and that's,",62,"we call them spin",79,"offs.",39,"And that's,",88,"you know,",52,"there's a lot of",57,"famous ones",64,"throughout nasa's",64,"history.",47,-1,0,"That's just an example",94,"of one that came",73,"about",53,"with all the",60,"work being done",64,"on the space",50,"station.",43,"Oh Yeah, you've",62,"heard of there's",64,"a lot of them,",52,"right?",19,"There's like",74,"memory",64,"foam is another",72,"one and like",88,"insulation",72,"for your house,",62,"stuff like that,",74,"like that, all",56,"that.",30,"There's",55,"a lot and",57,"we, we produce",107,"something called",69,"spin offs magazine",112,"where, I",56,"mean, it goes",50,"through just",55,"about every",84,"spin",57,"off, every",53,"technological",68,"spin off",55,"that's come",76,"from",116,"space",76,"based research",121,"that's used",59,"here on earth.",91,"And that's,",57,"that's just",58,"a symptom",126,"of",89,"doing",107,"research",74,"and development",81,"of this",79,"kind of funded",94,"research and",57,"development.",62,"People can",54,"find novel",82,"uses",67,"for technologies",123,"that were designed",73,"for one thing",73,"and it okay.",275,"So",51,"um let's",69,"take a step",54,"back.",42,-1,0,"And so we're",60,"talking about",79,"like all the",106,"experiments",79,"and like the reason",84,"that we're up there",86,"who's",107,"up there right",53,"now.",29,"So you say",56,"like, you",50,"know,",62,"if",89,"you're 16.5,",145,"right?",19,"I think is the number,",81,"if you're, if",64,"you're 16.5",91,"or younger, you've",57,"never lived in",55,"a time where",57,"people haven't",80,"been in space.",124,-1,0,"How many people",65,"are in space right",56,"now?",34,"6,",72,"6",58,"and its",79,"international,",79,"right?",25,"So we got,",73,"we have",148,"two",74,"Americans,",66,"right?",32,"Yeah.",39,"So",73,"international",88,"is the first",80,"word in the name",63,"of the station,",86,"the international",92,"space station.",66,"So there's always",56,"an international",89,"crew up",59,"there.",57,-1,0,"So right now",63,"there's two Americans,",117,"Peggy Whitson",65,"and Shane Kimbrough,",102,"one",60,"French astronaut",115,"uh to",56,"mop SK",91,"and",54,"three Russian",92,"cosmonauts.",106,"And so you,",77,"you have",52,"crew members, we've",65,"had crew members",117,"from",231,"And I'd have to",59,"look at the exact",84,"number.",40,"But I mean, countries",85,"all over the",53,"globe have",61,"flown crew",56,"members on",53,"board the space",68,"station.",127,-1,0,"18, I think",65,"is the number 18,",88,"18 is",61,"the latest",53,"and You've",132,"had",54,"well over",66,"200",53,"individuals",98,"travel",77,"to the space",55,"station",94,"and",87,"it is this",66,"global effort.",85,"You have",53,"15",64,"countries",58,"that are",54,"considered the",56,"main partnership.",97,"So these are the",53,"countries",80,"that",63,"signed all",52,"the papers",59,"and did everything",68,"back in the 90s",93,"to, to",74,"form this partnership.",143,-1,0,"And you have",61,"five",60,"main",56,"agencies.",80,"You have NASA",81,"here in the US,",117,"the Canadian",57,"Space Agency,",85,"right to our North,",121,"the European",73,"Space Agency,",85,"which actually",57,"incorporates",69,"a lot of",52,"different space",70,"agencies",50,"from all",51,"over Europe",100,"into one",100,"larger",62,"conglomeration.",150,-1,0,"The Russian",77,"Space Agency,",77,"Roskosmos",97,"and the Japanese",90,"Space Agency",80,"called Jaxa,",90,"the Japan",58,"Aerospace",58,"Exploration",83,"Agency.",93,-1,0,"And so",54,"lots of agencies,",106,"but",60,"all of",55,"this alphabet",81,"soup comes",71,"together",84,"to make",55,"the station",54,"possible.",69,"And so",77,"everything",55,"that gets done",64,"just about",80,"is done",53,"in this big",70,"collaboration.",88,"So you have these",61,"countries",79,"with",94,"drastic",73,"language barriers,",137,"cultural",66,"differences,",103,"sometimes",64,"governmental",56,"differences",71,"all working",72,"together",95,"on this massive",120,"multi billion",86,"dollar",58,"piece",85,"science",63,"research project.",118,"I think it's fair",54,"to say that",50,"space exploration",98,"is really",83,"a global",73,"interest,",60,"right?",31,"I mean,",71,"exploring",61,"the cosmos,",62,"it's not just",76,"a U",76,"S unique",63,"thing, it is",59,"really an international",97,"effort to make",50,"that possible.",76,"It's something",82,"that will",208,"as it does",73,"now and",53,"will certainly",96,"in the future",66,"involve",73,"the human",73,"race,",73,"not",77,"just",61,"one country.",186,-1,0,"I mean,",115,"especially",104,"as we continue",84,"to expand",72,"upon what",69,"we've done on",54,"the International",63,"Space Station.",79,"And we've",71,"even recognized",136,"that",67,"future",67,"emissions.",105,"There's",81,"there's a lot of",63,"reasons",50,"to increase",54,"international",74,"collaboration,",122,"whether it's",65,"drawing",70,"on other",52,"countries",50,"expertise.",118,"Um",70,"you know,",67,"one country",78,"is much better",67,"at doing",57,"one type of",51,"engineering",51,"than we are",63,"and vice versa",85,"or they have",69,"some kind of",54,"novel science.",101,"There's also",70,"the pooling of",67,"resources",86,"which can",92,"a lot of times",85,"be a major",74,"driver,",66,"going",77,"to Mars",57,"and going to other",71,"places",51,"is going to be",69,"very",54,"expensive.",123,"And so it",70,"makes a lot",73,"more sense",70,"to shoulder",113,"that burden",86,"across",65,"several",71,"countries",64,"who all have",65,"this kind",88,"of shared",72,"interest",69,"will probably",78,"have different",73,"main goals,",98,"which is true.",66,-1,0,"It's even true",63,"on board the space",77,"station, different",78,"agencies",61,"have different",72,"priorities",52,"for their research.",95,"But we all",65,"have that",52,"common",53,"goal of",61,"exploring",68,"space,",138,"improving",89,"the situation",71,"for people back",77,"here on earth",91,"and trying to",55,"push out",56,"further into",62,"the cosmos,",78,"into the galaxy,",100,"into, you know,",84,"making",60,"star wars",57,"a reality",67,"that kind of",52,"well",82,"start, start,",87,"start,",81,"start,",102,"start",110,"wars, we don't",51,"need to fight.",187,-1,0,"When I think",62,"one of my favorite",61,"things really,",52,"when you think about",59,"like global participation",124,"is uh",165,"the way that",60,"the modules",59,"are designed.",68,"So",63,"like each",54,"of them were",50,"just given",102,"specific",54,"like specifications.",93,"This is how",50,"it needs to be built",113,"and they",57,"built them all",73,"over the world",89,"and then",51,"launch them up",51,"into space",51,"and connected",59,"them for the first",61,"time in space.",90,"Really everyone",91,"had to be working",53,"together constantly",69,"to make sure that",74,"that actually",61,"happened",61,"and then you",61,"have to launch into",62,"space, then you",50,"have to connect",68,"it in space,",74,"make sure it",52,"works, make sure",65,"all the systems",59,"are integrated.",82,"That's crazy.",93,"It is.",73,"And again,",66,"that comes back",68,"to you have",57,"these countries",83,"with, I",85,"mean language",69,"barriers",76,"and just",83,"completely different",74,"ways of engineering",106,"and everything.",81,"But",53,"we built",67,"the station",59,"piece by",52,"piece in",62,"outer space.",103,"Like you",51,"just said, none",80,"of these things were",54,"connected on",56,"the ground the first",68,"time.",24,-1,0,"So",53,"you",53,"better make sure",70,"that when you set",59,"it up to space,",81,"it's gonna",72,"like",60,"you didn't",52,"build a",73,"square peg",66,"for a round",50,"hole kind",57,"of thing.",46,"So we",65,"add, we",56,"there are definitely",99,"ways to",52,"share that",68,"knowledge,",58,"to share the",59,"technology,",81,"to make sure",117,"that",103,"all",75,"of your,",75,"you know, you",61,"can agree",82,"on standards",119,"essentially",94,"to make sure",52,"everything talks",67,"to each other,",78,"all the different",70,"electronics",67,"or all the different",60,"structural",50,"systems, all",65,"of these different",54,"things.",54,"But",50,"it was still",107,"monumental",133,"to build",102,"this piece",52,"by piece.",53,"I mean, it",52,"was literally",68,"done piece",66,"by piece.",74,"You had",77,"elements",60,"launch on",65,"either Russian",75,"proton",52,"rockets are",52,"carried up",56,"in the space",58,"shuttle",52,"where it",66,"would arrive.",74,"A big",60,"robotic",53,"arm would reach",78,"in and grab",82,"it out of the shuttle",96,"payload",58,"bay and",84,"then they'd attach",81,"it and you might",57,"have to do space",87,"walks",64,"and I",50,"mean,",68,"unfurling",78,"and solar",53,"arrays and",59,"all these,",64,"you",50,"know, gigantic",129,"task",113,"and it was done",56,"piece by piece",89,"by people",102,"talking",59,"and working",50,"together all",90,"over the planet.",116,-1,0,"And",116,"there's really",73,"not another",169,"engineering",63,"project or",56,"even big",85,"project",69,"like that that",73,"exists.",113,"I",59,"think it's, it",112,"has been described",94,"as one of the greatest",101,"engineering",56,"feats",69,"in human history.",90,"Not to toot",64,"our own horn.",71,"We",54,"would certainly,",108,"I would",63,"certainly argue",95,"that building",82,"a football",99,"sized million",98,"pound spacecraft",118,"in space",107,"is definitely",87,"up there.",51,"Yeah, that",68,"is definitely.",115,"Yeah,",70,"I would rank it",54,"number one.",48,"But yeah, who",53,"am I to say a",94,"little bit so,",184,"okay, let's,",50,"let's kind of",57,"think about like",55,"what it looks",53,"like, right.",41,"And how it operates.",85,"So we",71,"talked about",55,"how you, you",59,"don't have access",82,"to,",58,"you can't just",62,"walk outside",86,"or you can't drill",72,"for more resources.",86,"Everything has to",60,"be there.",74,"So it's got to",50,"have power,",69,"it's got to have",53,"air, it's gotta",68,"have water,",66,"you have",71,"all these things.",68,-1,0,"So",75,"let's power.",131,"Where does it",57,"get?",21,"Its main power?",92,"The sun,",99,"everything",113,"comes from",58,"the sun.",51,"Now, it's,",158,"it's incredible",94,"and a",51,"lot of spacecraft",90,"do this because",76,"you, you have",71,"the sun.",59,"I mean the sun",79,"is we",81,"have solar energy",79,"here on",54,"earth.",41,"But",96,"in outer",66,"space, you",58,"can have even",64,"more direct",73,"access to the",58,"sun, readily",176,"available",52,"energy sources",128,"that we",54,"know how to",60,"harness.",82,"We know",56,"how to make solar",71,"arrays.",61,"And we have",66,"gigantic",68,"ones on",64,"board the station.",62,"So every",68,"all the",53,"power on station",83,"is generated",78,"through solar",87,"energy",81,"and",183,"We had talked",70,"about they see",54,"16",54,"sunrises",66,"and sunsets",62,"a day.",28,"So about half",70,"the time they're",63,"in complete",50,"darkness.",63,"So there is no",64,"sun.",103,-1,0,"So",61,"what you have",69,"is you have these",66,"great big solar",80,"rays that are generating",101,"power",62,"and then",53,"there's a bunch of",56,"batteries",60,"on board",65,"and the solar",58,"rays are just charging",84,"up those batteries.",81,"So every time",55,"they slip behind",71,"the earth again",64,"and they're in",57,"nighttime,",104,"those batteries",79,"are just supplying",64,"power to everything.",147,-1,0,"But",52,"it's 100%",129,"solar,",69,"renewable,",63,"clean",90,"sun",55,"energy.",81,"It's all",55,"solar energy",96,"and their",69,"massive",61,"right is, I",65,"think it's, they",104,"actually, they're",60,"so big",75,"and they produce",61,"so much power",76,"that actually",102,"they do have",65,"to, like,",133,"kind of",54,"get rid of",51,"some of that power",67,"because it's, it's",53,"kind of, it's",53,"a little bit redundant.",83,"Right.",15,"Just in case one of",53,"them breaks,",76,"like you",60,"still have enough",52,"power to power.",66,"You",68,"do have",58,"redundancy",67,"built in.",56,"Redundancy",71,"is one of",58,"our favor words,",101,"redundancy",82,"is a fancy",55,"word for backup",84,"plan.",56,"And",90,"at NASA,",67,"we always have",81,"backup plans",72,"for your backup",69,"plans.",43,"So yeah,",87,"even if you",61,"lose, we call",63,"them power channels.",82,"If you lose",54,"one, you lose",59,"two, you can still",70,"power",71,"the majority",75,"of all of your",54,"systems on",59,"board.",52,"And even",74,"going beyond",73,"that, if you lose,",96,"you know,",72,"a much",63,"larger amount",64,"of power,",55,"you can still",63,"power your key",71,"systems and",59,"everything.",42,-1,0,"You might just power",73,"down other things",70,"temporarily",70,"while you",57,"fix the",55,"problem.",79,"But",170,"it,",50,"they generate",103,"pretty much",66,"a comparable",96,"amount to",82,"keep",50,"everything",73,"that we want",65,"on board.",46,"And that's,",57,"that's all",50,"the life support",75,"that's keeping",50,"the lights on,",123,"that's running",72,"all of the experiments",108,"on board,",51,"all of the different",81,"hardware",58,"just keeping",50,"the station,",86,"you know, oriented",111,"in the right",62,"attitude",80,"and flying",67,"it and any",66,"time, I mean,",70,"everything,",73,"everything, everything,",80,"everything",81,"is powered",55,"by the solar",66,"rays and",102,"it, I mean,",63,"it doesn't",55,"generate an overwhelming",117,"excess of",59,"energy",83,"by any",61,"means because",66,"again, you are",64,"spending a lot",57,"of time in darkness.",111,"So those",54,"batteries",54,"are getting used",121,"pretty much constantly.",127,"We're in the process",96,"of swapping",65,"the batteries,",67,"we're upgrading.",115,-1,0,"We've already",64,"upgraded",129,"1/4",154,"of them",154,"switched out",76,"nickel hydrogen",100,"for lithium",59,"ion.",38,"That is correct.",71,"That's right.",93,"Lithium maya,",126,"there were way more",56,"efficient.",44,"Right.",22,"Yeah, but",60,"that, I mean,",56,"that's, that's",68,"the power",51,"story.",44,"It's, it's,",60,"it's all solar",129,"energy",56,"through those pigs",67,"and they are, they",59,"are very",51,"large",79,"and we",79,"come back to the",59,"football field,",63,"the American",54,"football field",88,"analogy,",67,"we haven't clarified",86,"yet yet.",39,"Have uh",208,"that",119,"the solar",68,"rays are",71,"basically",56,"each, each",57,"solar ray is",62,"the size of",50,"an end zone",102,"and there",60,"are eight",51,"of those.",192,-1,0,"Yes,",103,"that are the size",78,"of an ends or",219,"like a",151,"pair",53,"of four.",61,"So",57,"four.",63,"It's tough",79,"because like",88,"one pair",79,"is actually",65,"two array",77,"blankets,",82,"but",66,"they're very",67,"large.",173,-1,0,"Okay.",38,"So that's power,",67,"right?",31,"So we already",62,"talked about water",91,"because",61,"you need to recycle",76,"water and",64,"make sure",53,"you have enough",68,"and water is very",65,"expensive to",54,"launch.",49,"And if",65,"you recycle",61,"it, it's a lot",66,"more efficient",77,"and it's",71,"very,",52,"very clean.",65,"So, what",56,"about air?",66,"Right.",44,"That's",60,"one thing you,",60,"you know, you think about",73,"like what a human",68,"needs shelter,",84,"water,",113,"food,",65,"you didn't",60,"really think",52,"about air because,",134,"but",74,"that's something",51,"you definitely need.",65,"That's, again,",72,"that's something",51,"we kind of take",65,"for granted",54,"that air",54,"is just, it's,",87,"it's air,",52,"it's everywhere",67,"down here.",68,"But up there",88,"you're in a, you're",61,"in a sealed",71,"environment.",65,"You're basically",51,"in a big",82,"sealed",70,"tin can",82,"and",61,"you",69,"need to fill",68,"that with there.",74,"So they,",180,"we can launch",84,"air",51,"just",56,"like we can launch",63,"water.",32,"You can launch a",54,"tank of super",78,"pressurized",65,"air usually",82,"in its liquid",60,"form",61,"and then",65,"feed it into",56,"the atmosphere.",107,-1,0,"But",54,"the main way we",65,"get it",67,"is",52,"from",72,"water.",70,"We",116,"use a system",88,"called the oxygen",99,"generation",72,"system",79,"that actually",67,"takes water,",157,"splits",106,"the atom,",117,"splits",74,"the atom, but",87,"it splits",69,"the",56,"a water molecule",99,"into oxygen",89,"and hydrogen.",105,-1,0,"And then we can",51,"take that oxygen",102,"and pump",79,"it into the atmosphere",124,"and",72,"they aren't",81,"in",93,"pure",73,"oxygen",53,"atmosphere.",56,"So there's other stuff",69,"in there, there's a",56,"lot of nitrogen.",106,"So",289,"they're basically",89,"in the exact",55,"same composition",93,"atmosphere",50,"that we have",52,"on earth and actually",81,"the same pressure",87,"too.",136,-1,0,"So",109,"there's,",72,"there's no big",70,"difference there.",94,"Uh",65,"that feeds into",69,"some of the stuff they",72,"do for spacewalks,",103,"but that's a completely",96,"different tangent",92,"I can go",50,"on.",31,"But",131,"so",61,"we, we,",57,"we split",54,"the water molecules.",95,"So then you",56,"have your",74,"oxygen, which",59,"you can just feed",72,"directly back",67,"into the cabin",56,"and then you have hydrogen",142,"which",59,"you can",82,"vent overboard",109,"if you just build",68,"up a bunch of",50,"excess hydrogen",100,"or",130,"there's a process",101,"in a, in a",52,"payload up",58,"there.",27,"It's,",62,"it's used,",90,"it's more of a",50,"technology",53,"demonstration.",69,"So it's not",55,"really",58,"in the,",72,"in the critical",62,"path.",62,"So it's not",56,"a critical",53,"piece that",50,"we have to have",64,"running at all",58,"times.",45,"But it's",57,"called,",66,"the Sabatier",91,"uses",107,"the Sabatier",65,"process",69,"where",66,"you can take",55,"that hydrogen",101,"that you have left",61,"over from your water.",157,-1,0,"And then you",55,"can take",91,"the carbon",77,"dioxide",100,"that gets scrubbed",83,"out of the atmosphere",70,"by a different",72,"device,",64,"you",57,"split that carbon",69,"dioxide,",59,"you now",52,"have",70,"oxygen",175,"and then you have your",62,"leftover hydrogen.",94,"You combine those",62,"two and",56,"you got more water.",119,-1,0,"And so you",55,"can kind",50,"of build",88,"the, the",74,"ideal",87,"is to",52,"build, we call",53,"it a closed",58,"loop.",58,"So",96,"everything",82,"that gets put",69,"into this",78,"life support",92,"loop, it's",62,"a big circle",133,"Just constantly",86,"gets recycled.",89,"You got",56,"your water,",71,"you drink",74,"your water,",74,"you recycle",89,"your water,",64,"you take some",53,"of that water,",75,"you turn it",50,"into a row",54,"and oxygen,",86,"you",71,"take that",65,"excess hydrogen,",87,"you combine it",56,"with CO2",71,"that the astronauts",64,"are breathing out,",61,"you make more",54,"water.",78,-1,0,"And so it's all",70,"just kind of constantly",95,"going around",74,"in a circle.",102,"And that way",67,"you get",52,"the absolute",91,"most",68,"out of everything",97,"you send",53,"up there.",80,"That's crazy.",74,"You actually have",61,"to",56,"create",124,"an atmosphere",94,"right",62,"there.",37,"It's not like",66,"earth where",66,"it kind",52,"of does it for",68,"us.",22,"You actually have",54,"to make it",56,"work.",36,"That's crazy.",104,"I like the",57,"Sabbath a",51,"system.",35,"That's cool.",30,"He says the technology",93,"demonstration,",83,"I thought it was",58,"like part of the",54,"whole thing because",61,"I know",56,"they called",69,"it a partially",56,"closely because",65,"like you said,",64,"you can inject",57,"the hydrogen",55,"if you have",56,"too much,",68,"right?",33,"So",54,"it's, but",90,"it's a kind",53,"of the same concept.",154,-1,0,"So,",67,"okay.",52,"So they have",62,"air, they have",63,"water,",68,"they have power,",98,"they have all kinds",68,"of stuff.",37,"So let's talk",64,"about",65,"um",75,"like",52,"the some",60,"of the experiments",91,"I know one of",50,"the biggest one",87,"is",95,"the experiment",83,"on themselves,",109,"right?",48,"So",63,"you",81,"in order",60,"to actually function",96,"beyond",72,"low earth orbit",88,"and actually",53,"function in",58,"space, you have",54,"to learn",74,"how the human",57,"body",57,"reacts",94,"in space",62,"and what happens.",82,"So I think",58,"the biggest",51,"thing uh",117,"maybe it's not",63,"the biggest thing,",57,"but it's definitely",55,"a very important",100,"is",76,"bone",97,"loss and",55,"muscle degradation,",88,"right?",37,"So",122,"that is",88,"if you're in",57,"space",54,"for too",76,"long and",66,"you're just kind of",56,"floating around",87,"your",54,"bones start",68,"to exhibit",95,"symptoms",102,"of osteoporosis",107,"and your",57,"muscles start",67,"to degrade.",134,-1,0,"So",72,"how do they counter",61,"that?",47,"Yeah.",91,"Well, when",63,"we talk research,",162,"there's",56,"really, there's",70,"kind of two",95,"different",66,"camps,",65,"there's",163,"the",100,"research",62,"that we're doing",94,"on",51,"board the station",66,"to get us ready",83,"to go",75,"on to Mars",69,"explore",78,"the solar",122,"system, all",54,"those other things,",84,"which is a lot",62,"of what you were just",55,"talking about.",48,"And then there's the",56,"research",91,"that has",63,"direct applications",104,"on earth",54,"and we can, we",63,"can dive",60,"into that",51,"too.",53,"But that's",66,"research flown",83,"by commercial",85,"companies",76,"by,",55,"you know,",55,"academia",109,"taking advantage",93,"of this micro",56,"gravity environment",88,"because we've,",71,"we've seen",112,"there's a lot",75,"you can learn",56,"by taking gravity",90,"out of the equation.",106,"But",121,"to the first",59,"camp",90,"to the, to",61,"the, you",64,"know, studying",68,"the people,",52,"the astronauts",70,"are guinea pigs",83,"kind of thing.",83,-1,0,"The",50,"human body",209,"is an incredible",98,"machine",143,"and it's incredible",101,"at adapting",97,"to different environments.",147,"I mean,",157,"that's,",55,"that's both a",54,"gift and a curse",106,"because",82,"when you go into",52,"outer space,",197,"I mean,",74,"your,",52,"your vestibular",72,"system, so",58,"your sense",51,"of, you know,",56,"up is down,",58,"down is up,",61,"your balance,",51,"all of that",74,"goes all,",65,"all out of",50,"whack.",33,"But within about",55,"a day or two,",62,"most astronauts",95,"don't",65,"have the nausea",69,"anymore.",44,"Their body",62,"is",77,"used to it",55,"already",65,"and they're able",66,"to live and work.",83,"Which",62,"that's incredible.",110,"That's a great",86,"advantage",65,"to just",76,"getting",55,"into a new environment",101,"and hitting the ground",84,"running.",69,-1,0,"The problem",78,"with that",72,"is when",56,"you get to an",57,"environment",64,"where you have",65,"gravity again,",77,"hitting the ground",60,"running can be",71,"very",51,"problematic",114,"because",55,"your body",62,"when it's not",143,"when gravity",79,"is not pulling",63,"down on you.",61,"So you",64,"and I right",51,"now,",100,"I mean, gravity",71,"is pushing down",75,"on you at all",67,"times",51,"and that",56,"builds up",63,"muscles",78,"in your hips",67,"and bones",50,"in your hips.",60,"And that's",58,"why",62,"your",50,"legs are",54,"strong enough",59,"to just",51,"hold",57,"you upright",58,"because they're constantly",104,"fighting against",76,"that force",113,"on places",84,"like the space",53,"station",87,"that",69,"force disappears.",133,"And",50,"so your",50,"body says,",59,"well,",51,"I don't need these",63,"muscles anymore.",95,"So it",66,"stops",52,"feeding",52,"nutrients",56,"to those.",46,"And so you",51,"can actually,",104,"um,",58,"astronauts",75,"will",74,"dispel.",99,"So in",53,"their urine, they'll",60,"get raised",119,"levels of calcium",107,"because their",53,"bones aren't",66,"needing it",59,"as much because",62,"their bones",50,"aren't getting",135,"that much",58,"force just",70,"by existing.",132,-1,0,"They're getting",61,"rid of the calcium",58,"because it",50,"doesn't,",52,"the body saying",71,"you don't need this",52,"anymore.",37,"And so",91,"understanding",88,"a lot of those",57,"processes",87,"is important",139,"because",65,"I mean, if the astronauts",89,"were just going to stay",81,"in microgravity",84,"forever,",71,"not that",66,"big of a deal",75,"because their body",76,"just adapts",72,"and",62,"I mean, they",52,"become space",71,"people,",62,"but",105,"astronauts",60,"come back to earth,",100,"astronauts",59,"will walk on",60,"mars where",56,"there is gravity,",80,"less gravity,",62,"but still gravity",95,"and you're gonna need",68,"to walk",82,"around in a",65,"pretty heavy",50,"space suit",57,"and things like",58,"that.",61,-1,0,"So finding",96,"ways",55,"to",55,"counteract",117,"calling countermeasures",112,"for all",58,"all the ways",69,"the body adapts",107,"is,",52,"it's",79,"something that we've",64,"been doing",78,"pretty much as long",70,"as we've been doing",60,"spaceflight,",62,"but we've",77,"really",87,"aggressively",163,"pursued",60,"it onboard",112,"the space station.",91,"So for",66,"example, bone",67,"loss and muscle",69,"loss, we've",123,"actually",94,"pretty",90,"much reversed.",111,"For the most",62,"part,",55,"all",70,"of the bone loss",71,"and muscle loss,",62,"you'll still see",105,"changes in",58,"bone density",120,"in some of",51,"the crew members,",81,"but a lot",63,"of them",52,"aren't",79,"losing",52,"that bone",51,"mass, that",51,"muscle mass.",65,"That was such",53,"a problem",88,"in early",73,"long duration",71,"spaceflight.",141,-1,0,"And we do",51,"that through",50,"exercise.",82,"That is,",70,"that is",55,"the main",77,"driver.",72,"There's exercise",110,"and",58,"there's nutrition",72,"but exercise,",65,"the crew members",65,"are working out",121,"about two",57,"hours every",56,"single day.",98,"I don't know about",59,"you,",51,"but I don't",66,"work out two",52,"hours every",57,"single day.",52,"30 minutes.",57,"I'm pretty much",161,"even,",56,"that can be",57,"hard for some",59,"people to find.",50,"But the crew",53,"members",53,"two hours",86,"every single",65,"day and",60,"that's exercise",133,"both",87,"cardio",104,"and",95,"resistance.",88,"So",62,"they have",53,"a number of devices",98,"up there.",89,"They have a",52,"treadmill,",72,"which",83,"again, you",69,"need to remember",114,"everything",53,"and this is the running",74,"theme.",33,"Everything we do",65,"in microgravity",115,"is different.",99,"So you",51,"can't just hop",66,"on a treadmill,",62,"you'll just float",87,"away",87,"and you'll just be",59,"pumping your legs",77,"and microgravity",89,"and that does",61,"nothing for",55,"you.",47,-1,0,"So the treadmill",82,"actually has a",55,"harness",69,"with basically",81,"bungee cables",128,"that pulls",84,"them down",78,"towards",70,"the treadmill.",72,"So that way",52,"you're getting the",51,"force in your",61,"legs,",52,"you're actually",78,"exerting",50,"more force",79,"and",55,"you can, you",69,"can run, it's",65,"closer, you can get",68,"to just running",71,"in space.",85,"And I mean, we've had",65,"astronauts",64,"run marathons",97,"on the treadmill",155,"and that's one",57,"of their key",56,"devices.",81,"They also have",60,"something",86,"called the",59,"advanced resistive",94,"exercise",53,"device.",48,"I've stayed away",63,"from acronyms",66,"as much as possible",136,"so far,",91,"but",70,"they inevitably",76,"come up, we call",70,"it a red",95,"and it",55,"is,",54,"it's their,",69,"it's basically their",64,"home gym",78,"on board",61,"the station.",59,"Now again,",88,"you can't just",57,"pick up a heavy",66,"weight and",65,"do some car",71,"and, you",54,"know, get a workout.",346,-1,0,"There's microgravity.",85,"So, I mean, they can,",81,"they literally",75,"move several",92,"\u00a3100",128,"modules",64,"and pieces of hardware",74,"all the time.",141,-1,0,"And so",52,"to help",57,"simulate",58,"weightlifting,",64,"it actually",50,"uses a series",94,"of pneumatic",73,"tubes",111,"to simulate",103,"force",103,"and they can",67,"actually simulate",93,"up to \u00a3600",113,"of force,",98,"which",89,"some of the astronauts",133,"there squat",87,"squat number",64,"goes up when",55,"they're up there.",68,"And",61,"it's slightly",53,"misleading because",78,"they're not squatting",66,"their own body",58,"weight like they",50,"are here on",60,"earth, it's",126,"still \u00a3600.",115,"I don't think, I",61,"don't think any of",54,"them do \u00a3600",128,"but they have",57,"the option",58,"if, if",58,"we ever",57,"get some",58,"power lifters",129,"up on board",67,"the station",67,"and then they also have",58,"a stationary",56,"bicycle",149,"and then there's",68,"another treadmill.",95,"So there's actually,",60,"well, there's two treadmills",107,"onboard the",52,"station.",54,"But",115,"I mean, they",73,"use all",51,"those two",71,"hours a day",116,"just",76,"and that's just",58,"to maintain",135,"that bone",69,"and muscle.",181,-1,0,"And",74,"there's also",59,"ways you can",72,"help",50,"that process",65,"through nutrition",98,"or constantly",61,"looking.",57,"Is there",52,"a better",59,"way for them",60,"to work out?",85,"Should they do?",65,"I mean, there's something,",135,"there are research",107,"projects",52,"like sprint,",105,"where",57,"does it make",54,"sense for them",52,"to work out?",106,"You know, a",51,"lot harder",97,"but for",58,"a shorter amount",66,"of time",80,"like high intensity",112,"interval.",46,"Yeah,",53,"because",50,"two hours is",63,"a long time",73,"every single",55,"day.",88,-1,0,"That's a lot",55,"to ask.",95,"But",56,"so",71,"and crew time",61,"is very valuable,",89,"right?",30,"Because they,",80,"I mean, you're talking",68,"about like you said,",74,"202",181,"100 experiments",84,"per increment,",86,"right?",20,"And astronauts",91,"150",124,"is the",51,"usual",58,"is the usual",67,"number in like",71,"six months,",183,"250",74,"experiments",60,"will happen on board",70,"the station.",56,"That's crazy.",74,"So yeah,",58,"crew time is",50,"very valuable",72,"and that's",79,"two hours",80,"gone every",80,"day from",94,"experiment",57,"time just",93,"to maintain",112,"my bone",94,"and muscle",86,"mass.",223,-1,0,"And that's just",78,"one",60,"part of",61,"what changes",116,"when you're",57,"in microgravity.",112,"I mean, they're",92,"the your",138,"body actually",66,"has less",55,"blood in it.",67,"By the time",60,"you come home,",85,"your heart",99,"can change",64,"sizes because",84,"it doesn't work",80,"as hard to pump",74,"the blood.",64,"And",53,"then one of the",50,"big",51,"outstanding",91,"ones",69,"that we're",152,"still",71,"addressing",113,"is",81,"vision changes",140,"and that's",58,"something",140,"that",137,"we knew",57,"about",79,"but was",51,"never really",67,"considered",63,"a huge",127,"deal,",96,"not, not",68,"a huge deal,",61,"but never",63,"really considered",100,"a",64,"major impact",117,"until",77,"within the last",77,"couple of years",107,"when we had",76,"a significant",75,"amount of astronauts",111,"returning",75,"from these really",64,"long stays",55,"in space",77,"and",101,"reporting",55,"that their vision",65,"was worse",139,"and",68,"it's normal",73,"to come back",59,"to earth and",56,"have a couple",58,"of changes",59,"that linger",52,"for a little while.",82,-1,0,"But for",57,"these crew members,",80,"the vision never",63,"got better.",189,-1,0,"That's a concern",98,"if you send",54,"somebody to Mars",93,"and in",77,"the nine months",73,"or however",84,"long it ends",50,"up taking to",52,"get there",65,"all of",56,"a sudden they go",68,"from 2020",101,"to needing",87,"glasses",63,"to needing",91,"even stronger",61,"glasses that",63,"they don't have available",97,"and they land",50,"on Mars and they",52,"can't see",123,"that's",88,"a big issue.",129,-1,0,"And so we're trying",79,"to figure out",56,"exactly",88,"why",87,"this happens.",109,"There's a",57,"number of",94,"good",56,"ideas,",80,"good hypotheses.",130,"We think",64,"we know,",60,"but we're still",62,"doing a lot of",55,"tests to figure",62,"out exactly",65,"why it",56,"happens and",110,"just",72,"like the bone and",55,"muscle.",43,"How do we stop",72,"that from happening?",115,"So,",129,"you gotta find those",62,"countermeasures",59,"to make that happen.",163,-1,0,"Wow, that's",76,"really intense.",82,"I mean, imagine",72,"getting like landing",80,"on Mars",60,"and",60,"you can't",69,"see anything.",60,"It would be kind",53,"of a buzzkill",102,"travel",152,"60 million",68,"miles",50,"and get out and",57,"everything is blurry.",90,"Yeah,",108,"that wouldn't",68,"make me happy.",82,"So, I know",75,"like when",67,"here's another",66,"thing when",110,"astronauts,",68,"so astronauts",58,"now they're doing",85,"on the international",91,"space station",65,"pretty regularly,",87,"they're doing",50,"long duration",97,"increments.",52,"Right.",17,"So, they're doing six",71,"months at a time.",209,-1,0,"So this",59,"is longer",50,"than any",66,"of the shuttle missions",88,"or a lot of",51,"the missions before",83,"it.",16,"And it's all",61,"to practice",52,"for, for",64,"emissions",71,"missions",93,"beyond",67,"low earth orbit.",113,-1,0,"But",57,"when they come",62,"back",68,"to earth,",68,"right, they",107,"generally, right",69,"now they come",56,"back in a Soyuz",92,"land in Kazakhstan.",104,"And then we have",62,"recovery",50,"teams that go",55,"out and get them,",125,"but",63,"they have",89,"a hard time",50,"walking right",73,"when they first,",100,"when they first",54,"get out, some",77,"do.",44,"And so",64,"that's, that's",78,"part of",72,"again, the",98,"human",56,"body",78,"reacting",93,"to the different",67,"environments.",65,"When, when",60,"astronauts",50,"first get into",58,"space, some",57,"will have nausea,",95,"some will have",92,"some adverse",76,"reactions",62,"to being in microgravity.",131,"The same is",59,"true when",72,"you're in microgravity",113,"for a really long",54,"time and",67,"you come back down",65,"to earth all",50,"of a sudden there's",64,"this, this",83,"huge",50,"weight pressing",82,"down on you",59,"though, hasn't",60,"been there for",51,"the last six",67,"months or however",96,"long you were there.",106,"There's",83,"your, your",53,"inner ear",64,"goes crazy",95,"again, like",68,"all the",55,"fluids pulling",73,"down again.",67,-1,0,"Where",61,"am I?",36,"There used to be",58,"no up and",60,"down.",34,"But now all",50,"of a sudden there's",62,"definitely",50,"a down",99,"and so",55,"it can",69,"be tough",67,"just to",85,"just to",64,"walk.",90,"I mean, we,",100,"we",100,"will, we",52,"have teams",67,"that",72,"pretty much",56,"carry the astronauts",99,"out of the spacecraft",126,"and then",50,"onto a medical",75,"tent.",41,"So we try",57,"to minimize",82,"any of that",98,"real discomfort",114,"and things like",57,"that for these",54,"crew members,",82,"but",208,"they are still",62,"test subjects.",68,"And so we still",55,"do stuff to",54,"them.",79,-1,0,"And part of",54,"that is",146,"when,",54,"let's",63,"say you're the first",79,"person to go",54,"to Mars",52,"when you land,",105,"it's not gonna be",57,"there.",11,"Anybody there",60,"to pull you out",51,"of your capsule",79,"or help you set",66,"up camp",97,"or anything like",68,"that, you're",121,"on your own.",94,-1,0,"And so we",52,"need to make sure",69,"before we send",67,"somebody,",56,"how",150,"much",78,"can they do",68,"on their own.",175,-1,0,"And we",51,"have these crew",67,"members coming",61,"back from extended",78,"periods in space",80,"and we have the",86,"ability",54,"to test them.",96,-1,0,"And now",106,"every",52,"astronaut",149,"is",158,"an incredibly",73,"gracious person",98,"because",61,"not a",57,"lot of this",51,"testing isn't",71,"glamorous",123,"and it can be",127,"a little uncomfortable.",146,"They are",84,"guinea pigs",77,"in almost every",74,"sense of

science.",101,"But",105,"one of the things",51,"that we do",81,"and we started",69,"doing within the",50,"last couple of years",68,"is called the field",67,"test.",87,-1,0,"So they'll",73,"come home",139,"the land",51,"in the middle of Kazakhstan,",138,"pull them out of",52,"the capsule",129,"and then",92,"we subject",70,"them to a series",100,"of, they sound",90,"really simple,",106,"but it's",54,"just functional",107,"tests",61,"and it's",66,"things",57,"like walking",72,"a straight line,",185,"sitting",63,"down and standing",95,"up, laying",124,"down and",51,"standing up,",105,"standing up",62,"and having somebody",82,"push you a",54,"little bit.",80,"It's all these",74,"things that,",114,"you know,",62,"that sounds,",165,"that sounds really",75,"easy.",38,"Like

it's,",130,"it's, and",68,"again, when I,",58,"when I say",50,"they're truly",95,"gracious people,",99,"they",60,"have to sacrifice",96,"a lot",59,"for",79,"this.",35,-1,0,"I mean,",56,"you",57,"know,
