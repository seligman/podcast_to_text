astronauts,",93,"pretty much all",63,"the folks that",63,"have the coolest",63,"information, the stuff",63,"you really want",63,"to know,",77,"right on",56,"the show",56,"and tell",56,"you more",56,"about all",56,"things NASA.",86,"We're talking",62,"everything from",62,"extraterrestrial dirt",62,"to the",61,"unknown parts",62,"of the",62,"universe.",57,"So today",54,"on the",53,"first episode",53,"ever, we're",54,"talking International",53,"Space Station",53,"with Dan",104,"Hewitt.",74,"He's the public",72,"affairs officer for",73,"the space station",73,"program here at",73,"the NASA Johnson",72,"Space Center",95,"in Houston,",70,"Texas.",60,"And we had",73,"a great discussion",74,"about what the",73,"International Space Station",74,"is, how it",73,"works, what",79,"it's made",55,"of, and",55,"why it's",54,"there.",47,-1,0,"So with no",60,"further delay, let's",60,"go light speed",59,"and jump right",60,"ahead to our",60,"talk with Mr.",93,"Dan Hewitt.",117,"Enjoy.",166,-1,0,"T-minus",117,"five",117,"seconds",116,"in,",117,"counting.",167,"Mark.",150,-1,0,"Launch",100,"commit",100,"lights",100,"are",100,"correct.",175,"Here",75,"she",75,"goes.",141,"Houston,",67,"we",67,"have",66,"a",67,"podcast.",133,"It's",67,"true.",133,"Very",67,"true.",100,"So anyway,",67,"let's begin.",90,"I figured you're",66,"the perfect person",66,"to have here",67,"being the public",66,"affairs officer of",66,"the International",73,"Space Station.",98,"You talk",97,"to scientists,",97,"astronauts, engineers",97,"constantly.",77,"So you're",56,"very aware",56,"of what's",56,"going on",56,"and everything",56,"about the",56,"space station.",80,"So for those",72,"of you listening,",73,"I think this",73,"is a good",72,"opportunity to learn",73,"just everything about",99,"it, right?",79,"So start",60,"from the",59,"very beginning.",85,"What is",50,"it?",75,"Everything.",100,"Awesome.",80,"Well, to",59,"start in",61,"the beginning,",60,"no.",56,"So the",53,"space station",53,"is, it's",52,"a giant",53,"spaceship.",67,-1,0,"I mean,",80,"it is",80,"the largest",80,"spacecraft that",80,"humans have",80,"ever built.",112,"And we",64,"haven't been",64,"flying in",64,"space for",64,"too long,",64,"relatively.",56,"I mean, we've",72,"been up there",72,"for 50 or",72,"60 years, but",72,"the space station",72,"is kind of",72,"the pinnacle for",88,"what we've built",60,"so far.",65,"It is",50,"massive.",65,"I mean,",81,"this thing",81,"supports multiple",81,"people.",70,"It's been",59,"up there,",59,"at least",59,"pieces of",59,"it, since",59,"1998.",61,"So that's",62,"another one",62,"of those",62,"factoid alerts",63,"that we",62,"always like",62,"to tell",62,"people.",61,"If you",59,"were born",59,"after the",58,"year 1998,",59,"the spacecraft's",59,"always been",59,"up there,",59,"but if",93,"you were",68,"born after",68,"the year,",68,"after November",69,"of 2000,",68,"as long",68,"as you've",68,"been alive,",68,"human beings",105,"have been",71,"living and",71,"working in",70,"space.",65,"We are",58,"aliens.",71,"We are",84,"a space-faring",84,"species.",67,-1,0,"We are",50,"the ones",50,"off the",50,"planet.",52,"We've had",55,"people up",55,"there every",55,"single day",55,"for, as",55,"of right",55,"now, over",55,"16 years.",94,"I mean,",78,"that is",77,"mind-blowing.",69,"And they're",60,"doing stuff",60,"every single",60,"day.",52,"And it's either",68,"going to impact",69,"us here on",68,"Earth or get",68,"us ready to",68,"go further out.",93,"I mean, that",73,"is the purpose",73,"of the space",73,"station.",49,"That's why it's",74,"up there.",83,"That's why",66,"we have",66,"this huge",66,"thing floating",66,"above us.",91,"So you say",75,"stuff.",48,"We're doing stuff",70,"every day.",68,"Obviously, living up",64,"there, I think,",64,"is a big",65,"part of it,",64,"right?",52,"We're, like",62,"you said,",61,"we're explorers,",61,"we're spacefarers.",87,"What is",50,"the stuff",51,"that's actually,",50,"you know,",51,"that has",50,"that impact?",67,"It's a lot",50,"of stuff.",50,"It's a lot",50,"of stuff.",60,"And I",54,"mean, it",54,"is, and",53,"it's divided",54,"up.",58,"It is",62,"as simple",63,"as just",62,"living in",62,"space.",53,"So just everything",63,"you do in",64,"space is a",64,"little bit different",63,"than the way",64,"you do it",63,"down here",72,"on Earth.",69,-1,0,"I mean, it",58,"could be anything",58,"from going to",59,"the bathroom to",58,"how you eat",58,"to just how",58,"you get",84,"your water.",97,"Everything's different.",99,"So it's",64,"like a",64,"way to",64,"practice, really,",64,"for things",64,"further out.",84,"Because it's not",60,"really far up,",60,"right?",40,"It's only 250",60,"miles.",41,"If you think",64,"about it, we're",64,"still in the",64,"Earth's protection.",76,"Oh, yeah.",89,"Like, we're still",67,"protected by the",67,"Earth's magnetic field.",102,"And space",69,"is funny",69,"in that",70,"going up,",69,"it feels",69,"like it's",69,"so far",69,"away, space.",101,"But it's",65,"250 miles.",99,"That's not",70,"that far.",97,"I mean,",53,"I feel",53,"like the",53,"city of",53,"Houston is",53,"250 miles.",86,"It's not.",98,"But I",63,"mean, 250",63,"miles in",63,"a car",62,"is a",63,"short road",63,"trip.",62,"But 250",62,"miles straight",62,"up, that's",61,"a rocket",62,"ride.",58,"That's a",55,"slightly different",55,"road trip.",80,"But it",52,"isn't that",51,"far away.",90,"I mean,",77,"we still",76,"kind of",77,"are right",76,"on the",77,"doorstep.",96,-1,0,"There's",58,"a",57,"really",58,"great",57,"quote",58,"in",57,"the",58,"Paramount",57,"of",58,"Space",57,"movies,",58,"Armageddon,",57,"where",58,"Owen",57,"Wilson",84,"says, you",53,"know, we're",53,"not even",53,"in outer",53,"space yet.",77,"This is just",71,"like the beginning.",95,"And that's kind",70,"of where the",70,"station is.",72,"It's in",50,"space.",46,"It's in what",66,"we call low",65,"Earth orbit.",60,"So it's still",50,"pretty close.",61,"I mean,",54,"they could",55,"get in",54,"a Soyuz",54,"spacecraft and",55,"be back",54,"on the",55,"ground inside",54,"of a",54,"couple hours.",148,"So, I mean,",60,"you're still right",60,"on the doorstep.",86,"You're not",52,"really way",52,"out there",52,"yet.",50,"But it's getting",72,"us ready to",72,"go way out",72,"there.",54,"Well, that's",62,"the whole,",61,"so NASA",62,"describes it",61,"as Earth",62,"Reliant, right?",77,"So I kind of",60,"like the way they",60,"section it off, right?",88,"Earth Reliant",55,"means exactly",55,"what you",55,"said, right?",83,"So if",54,"something goes",54,"wrong, you",55,"can just",54,"hop in",54,"a spacecraft",55,"and be",54,"home in",54,"three hours.",81,-1,0,"And it's",53,"easy to",53,"get stuff",53,"there because",53,"it's only,",53,"I mean,",53,"some Soyuz",53,"rides have",53,"been as",82,"little as",56,"like six",56,"hours, right?",89,"Relatively easy.",117,"Relatively.",59,"Going to space is, yeah, let's-",54,"It's only rocket science.",53,"Don't want to",50,"trivialize it.",62,"It's still,",56,"and even,",57,"you're going",56,"to have",57,"to admonish",56,"myself, it's",57,"still not",56,"easy to",82,"go to",50,"space.",43,"It's still, I",54,"mean, it is",55,"rocket science.",73,"It's literal",72,"rocket science,",73,"which is",72,"hugely complex",73,"and there's",72,"always inherent",73,"risk and",102,"all these",59,"other things.",91,"But when",63,"you start",62,"comparing it",63,"to, you",63,"know, going",63,"to Mars",62,"or, you",63,"know, our",63,"far flung",105,"aspirations of",84,"spreading throughout",84,"the solar",84,"system and",84,"the galaxy",84,"and everything,",84,"when you",116,"compare it",74,"to that,",74,"it's, you",74,"know, doing",75,"hand quotes",74,"easy, but",74,"it's still",74,"a monumental",125,"undertaking.",100,-1,0,"Yeah.",71,"And that's why,",64,"so we're doing",65,"that, just like",64,"you said, in",65,"the future we",64,"want to go",98,"farther, right?",79,"So we want to",50,"go to Mars.",61,"We want to",69,"really just expand",69,"our presence in",69,"the solar system.",106,"So the",74,"International Space",74,"Station is",74,"a great",74,"way to",74,"practice that.",96,"It's a good,",68,"like you have",68,"a good understanding",68,"of what it",67,"takes to live",68,"in space, to",68,"operate in",89,"space.",56,"You can do",69,"a ton of",68,"science and learn",68,"how things interact.",93,"And then if",74,"you learn how",74,"things interact, you",75,"can design better",74,"systems to make",74,"them work",91,"better.",60,"I think",52,"one of",52,"the ones,",52,"I think",53,"capillary action,",52,"I think",52,"was a",52,"great one.",81,"Like the",57,"way that",57,"fluids move",56,"in space",57,"is kind",57,"of cool",57,"because they",57,"sort of",57,"like create",83,"a ball",54,"and there's",54,"no down.",85,"So if",63,"you're trying",62,"to design",63,"like a",63,"system that,",63,"like a",62,"rocket system",63,"in order",63,"to propel",91,"fuel, you",56,"need to,",56,"the fuel",56,"isn't going",56,"to go",56,"down, right?",84,-1,0,"Something kind",58,"of needs",57,"to have",57,"that sort",58,"of capillary",57,"action and",57,"a path",58,"to get",57,"there.",51,"Those little tiny",66,"things are things",66,"that make the",67,"huge difference in",66,"being able to",66,"kind of",56,"explore the solar",50,"system.",52,"Well, it",71,"all comes",71,"down to",71,"gravity and",71,"that's kind",71,"of the",71,"ultimate differentiator",71,"between why",84,"everything we do",74,"in outer space",73,"is different from",73,"the way we",74,"do it on",73,"Earth.",59,"Some of",70,"the stuff",70,"you touch",70,"on is",70,"very apt.",103,"I mean,",68,"just moving",67,"fluids where,",68,"you know,",68,"here on",67,"Earth, we",68,"almost take",67,"it for",68,"granted that",84,"everything settles",50,"towards the",50,"bottom.",50,"So in plumbing",75,"systems and everything,",75,"you can use",74,"that to your",75,"advantage.",47,"In space, you",67,"don't have that.",96,"And that",59,"affects everything",60,"from moving",59,"rocket fuel",59,"to, you",60,"know, I'm",59,"an astronaut",59,"and I",81,"need to get",65,"a drink of",64,"water.",62,"Well, that",80,"system has",80,"to be",80,"specifically designed",80,"to work",80,"in the",80,"absence of",80,"gravity.",67,-1,0,"And we've",55,"had a",55,"lot of",55,"practice, you",56,"know, since",55,"we've been",55,"flying in",55,"space since",55,"the 60s.",185,"But the",84,"station is",83,"really the",83,"first place",84,"you've had",83,"on this",84,"scale.",70,"There have",55,"been space",57,"stations in",55,"the past,",57,"both from",55,"the US",57,"and Russia,",55,"but the",57,"space station",130,"is",51,"really",51,"the",51,"modern",51,"cutting",51,"edge",51,"test",51,"bed",51,"for",51,"just",51,"doing",51,"and",51,"learning",51,"everything",103,"about",53,"living",53,"in",53,"space.",83,"And so",60,"you have",60,"all of",60,"these different",61,"technologies that,",60,"like I",60,"said earlier,",60,"everything you",87,"do in",53,"space is",53,"different from",53,"the way",53,"that you",53,"do it",53,"on planet",53,"Earth, where,",53,"you know,",95,"you have",83,"oxygen thanks",83,"to natural",83,"cycles and",83,"you have",83,"trees scrubbing",83,"carbon dioxide",83,"from your",122,"atmosphere and",80,"producing oxygen",80,"back for",80,"you.",77,-1,0,"You have",74,"water and",74,"lakes, reservoirs",74,"coming, literally",74,"raining down",74,"on you",74,"from the",74,"sky, where",95,"in space,",58,"none of",58,"that exists.",90,"You have",65,"to create",66,"it.",57,"You either have",73,"to bring it",72,"with you or",73,"find a way",73,"to create it.",97,"And that's something",75,"that we're doing",74,"on the station",74,"right now, where",74,"you're trying to,",105,"and that's",60,"one of",60,"those key,",60,"we always",60,"talk about",60,"the different",60,"technologies that",60,"you need,",100,"and technology",71,"is a",71,"really broad",70,"term, but",71,"one of",71,"the ones",71,"that is",70,"a lot",71,"probably easier",104,"to understand",69,"is how",69,"we get",69,"those things,",69,"how you",68,"get the",69,"water, how",69,"you get",69,"the air",98,"just for",60,"the crew",61,"members.",58,"And one",58,"of the",58,"things you've",58,"got to",58,"remember is,",58,"again, so",58,"we're close",58,"to Earth",58,"right now,",81,"so we can",72,"launch water, we",72,"can launch air,",71,"we can launch",72,"all these things",72,"to these crew",111,"members, but",78,"when they",77,"go to",79,"Mars, there's",78,"no resupply",78,"ship.",69,-1,0,"There's no,",60,"you know,",61,"hey, the",60,"water tank's",61,"getting low,",60,"let's stop",60,"off here",61,"and tap",60,"it off.",151,"You can't do",60,"that.",64,"So you've",88,"got to",89,"bring everything",89,"with you,",88,"and everything",89,"is heavy.",106,"So the more",53,"stuff you bring",52,"with you, the",53,"more fuel you",53,"need, the more",52,"expensive your mission,",78,"and it just",64,"kind of compounds",64,"on and on",64,"and on and",64,"on.",42,"And I'm going",63,"to ramble here",62,"for a while,",63,"because I love",62,"this subject.",65,"Okay, well, I'll",72,"kind of, I'm",71,"not going to",71,"stop you, I'm",72,"going to kind",71,"of like re-divert",122,"you.",74,"So one of",72,"the things on",72,"the International Space",72,"Station they're doing",72,"now to do",72,"exactly that,",71,"so you said",70,"things are heavy,",71,"right?",74,"Water.",72,"Water especially is",66,"very heavy.",75,"I forget",61,"the cost",63,"per pound",61,"in order",63,"to launch",61,"water.",65,"Always varies.",91,"Always varies, okay,",74,"that's good to",73,"know.",56,"But I",62,"know like",62,"one way",62,"they're actually",63,"doing, like",62,"helping that",62,"out for",62,"long duration",62,"missions is",98,"recycling.",63,-1,0,"And the",60,"recycling system",59,"is just",60,"top notch.",83,"So good that",69,"they actually brought",69,"the technology back",69,"down to Earth,",69,"and then actually",69,"is helping out",109,"third world",63,"countries with,",63,"you know,",64,"not access",63,"to any",63,"kind of",64,"clean drinking",63,"water.",57,"It's like",51,"the filtration",50,"system is",51,"that good.",78,"They drink",55,"their own",55,"urine, and",55,"it captures",55,"sweat and",55,"stuff like",55,"that, right?",88,"They do.",98,"That's always",62,"a fun",62,"ill moment",62,"for little",62,"kids and",62,"stuff when",62,"you tell",62,"them that.",103,"And there's",82,"the famous",82,"astronaut saying",82,"that yesterday's",82,"coffee is",82,"tomorrow's coffee.",104,"To where that's",66,"what you have",66,"to do when",67,"you have these",66,"weight limits and",66,"you're in this",103,"environment where,",74,"you know,",73,"outside your",74,"four metal",73,"walls is",74,"just a",73,"vacuum of",74,"nothingness.",60,"You have to",71,"find ways to",71,"conserve all those",71,"things.",60,"And we",72,"know very",73,"well here",72,"on planet",73,"Earth that",72,"conservation is",73,"a very",72,"important facet",106,"of life.",91,-1,0,"We try to",72,"do it through",72,"recycling and any",72,"number of things.",97,"It's 10",52,"times more",51,"important when",52,"you're in",52,"space and",51,"there is",52,"no, you",51,"know, corner",52,"store that",64,"you can run",57,"to and, you",57,"know, pick up",57,"some

water",55,"from all",54,"different sources,",110,"whether it's",82,"the astronauts",82,"urine, which",82,"is a",82,"major source,",82,"their sweat,",82,"condensation in",121,"the cabin,",79,"any

them",74,"to continue to",123,"reuse.",82,"And the",89,"percentages seem",89,"to vary,",89,"but I",89,"mean, we're",88,"reclaiming at",89,"least 85%",89,"of the",89,"astronauts urine",137,"back into",93,"potable water.",118,-1,0,"So drinkable",50,"water.",66,"I mean,",82,"that's incredible.",115,"And as",65,"you alluded",65,"to, we've",65,"actually taken",65,"that water",65,"recycling

problem",56,"off this",56,"world where",56,"we have",56,"the problem.",88,"And then",66,"we find",65,"a completely",66,"different use",65,"for this",66,"technology that",65,"it wasn't",66,"necessarily designed",99,"for.",60,"I mean,",54,"our scientists",54,"didn't set",53,"out to",54,"develop a",54,"water filtration",53,"system for",54,"places without",86,"clean drinking",66,"water on",65,"earth, but",66,"it ended",65,"up having",65,"a use",66,"there.",56,"And that's, we",71,"call them spin-offs.",99,-1,0,"And that's,",54,"you know,",54,"there's a",54,"lot of",55,"famous ones",54,"throughout

a",50,"lot of them, right?",67,"There's like",55,"memory foam",55,"is another",55,"one and",55,"like insulation",55,"for your",55,"house, stuff",55,"like that.",144,"Like that, all",50,"that

right?",138,"Yeah.",73,"So international is",71,"the first word",71,"in the name",71,"of the station.",122,"Sure.",75,"International space",50,"station.",54,"So there's",59,"always an",58,"international crew",59,"up there.",97,"Right now",76,"there's two",76,"Americans, Peggy",76,"Whitson and",76,"Shane Kimbrough,",76,"one French",76,"astronaut,

look",65,"up the",64,"exact number,",65,"but I",64,"mean, countries",89,"all over the",72,"globe have flown",72,"crew members on",72,"board the space",72,"station.",57,"Oh yeah.",79,"I think 18, I think",62,"is the number, 18 different",61,"countries.",31,"I think 18",55,"is the latest.",100,"And you've",90,"had well",90,"over 200",90,"individuals travel",90,"to the",91,"space station",90,"and it",90,"is this",90,"global effort.",175,"You have",59,"15 countries",60,"that are",59,"considered the",59,"main partnership.",83,"So these are",72,"the countries that",72,"signed all the",71,"papers and did",72,"everything back in",72,"the nineties",121,"to form",97,"this partnership.",132,"And you",68,"have five",69,"main agencies.",98,"You have",58,"NASA here",58,"in the",58,"US, the",59,"Canadian Space",58,"Agency right",58,"to our",58,"north, the",58,"European Space",90,"Agency, which",60,"actually incorporates",60,"a lot",60,"of different",60,"space agencies",60,"from

the",71,"station possible.",103,"And so",64,"everything that",63,"gets done",64,"just about",63,"is done",64,"in this",63,"big

it's",66,"not just",67,"a US",66,"unique thing.",93,"It is",52,"really an",52,"international effort",52,"to make",52,"that possible.",89,-1,0,"It's something",75,"that will,",75,"as it",75,"does now",75,"and will",75,"certainly in",75,"the future,",75,"involve the",142,"human",66,"race,",66,"not",67,"just",66,"one",66,"country.",101,"I mean,",69,"especially as",69,"we continue",69,"to expand",69,"upon what",69,"we've done",69,"on the",69,"International Space",130,"Station, and",95,"we've even",96,"recognized that",95,"future missions,",96,"there's a",95,"lot of",96,"reasons

don't",50,"need to fight.",88,"Yeah.",87,"See, I",75,"think one",75,"of my",75,"favorite things,",75,"really, when",75,"you think",75,"about global",75,"participation, is",124,"the way",86,"that the",86,"modules are",86,"designed.",74,-1,0,"So each",62,"of them",62,"were just",62,"given specifications,",62,"this is",62,"how it",62,"needs to",62,"be built,",62,"and they",84,"built them all",67,"over the world,",68,"and then launched",67,"them up into",67,"space and connected",68,"them for the",91,"first time in",70,"space.",46,"Really, everyone had",66,"to be working",66,"together

make",73,"sure all the",73,"systems are integrated.",107,"That's crazy.",100,"It is.",95,"And again,",56,"that comes",57,"back to,",56,"you have",57,"these countries",56,"with, I",57,"mean, language",56,"barriers and",103,"just completely",74,"different ways",75,"of engineering",74,"and everything.",108,"But we",66,"built the",66,"station piece",66,"by piece",65,"in outer",67,"space.",51,"Like you just",54,"said, none of",54,"these things were",55,"connected on the",54,"ground the first",54,"time.",42,"So you better",72,"make sure that",72,"when you set",72,"it up to",73,"space, it's going",72,"to, like, you",72,"didn't build",80,"a square",55,"peg for",56,"a round",57,"hole kind",56,"of thing.",86,-1,0,"So we",61,"had, there",60,"are definitely",61,"ways to",61,"share that",60,"knowledge, to",61,"share the",61,"technology, to",104,"make sure",87,"that all",87,"of your,",87,"you know,",87,"you can",87,"agree on",87,"standards, essentially,",87,"to make",111,"sure everything talks",72,"to each other,",72,"all the different",73,"electronics, or all",72,"the different structural",116,"systems, all",68,"of these",68,"different things.",104,"But it",73,"was still",74,"monumental to",73,"build this",74,"piece by",73,"piece.",64,"I mean,",57,"it was",56,"literally done",55,"piece by",57,"piece.",58,"You had",60,"elements launched",61,"on either",60,"Russian proton",61,"rockets or",60,"carried up",61,"in the",60,"space shuttle",84,"where it",53,"would arrive,",54,"a big",53,"robotic arm",54,"would reach",53,"in and",54,"grab

the",72,"planet.",80,"And there's",86,"really not",87,"another engineering",86,"project or",86,"even big",87,"project like",86,"that that",137,"exists.",87,"I think",74,"it has",74,"been described",75,"as one",74,"of the",74,"greatest engineering",75,"feats in",74,"human history.",106,"Not to",64,"toot our",63,"own horn,",64,"but we",64,"would certainly,",63,"I would",64,"certainly

rank",61,"it number",60,"one.",42,"But yeah, who am I",55,"to say, right?",67,"We're biased.",87,"A little bit",60,"biased.",40,"We're a little",60,"biased.",34,"So, okay, let's kind",59,"of think about like",59,"what it looks like,",58,"right, and how it",59,"operates.",41,"So we",54,"talked about",53,"how you",54,"don't have",53,"access to,",54,"you can't",53,"just walk",54,"outside

it's got",52,"to have all",85,"these things.",83,"So let's,",66,"power, where",66,"does it",66,"get its",66,"main power?",100,"The sun.",100,"The sun.",89,"Everything comes from",65,"the sun.",96,"Now,",52,"it's,",53,"it's",52,"incredible.",74,"And a lot",67,"of spacecraft do",68,"this because you",67,"have the sun.",98,"I mean,",60,"the sun",60,"is, we",61,"have solar",60,"energy here",61,"on Earth,",60,"but in",61,"outer space,",60,"you can",60,"have even",80,"more direct access",73,"to the sun.",109,"It's a",71,"very readily",72,"available energy",71,"source

every,",79,"all the",78,"power on",79,"station is",79,"generated through",79,"solar energy.",111,"And we",66,"had talked",66,"about, they",66,"see 16",65,"sunrises and",66,"sunsets a",66,"day.",57,-1,0,"So about half",75,"the time they're",74,"in complete darkness.",109,"So there",68,"is no",68,"sun.",57,"So what you",72,"have is you",71,"have these great",71,"big solar arrays",72,"that are generating",71,"power, and then",95,"there's a bunch",70,"of batteries on",71,"board.",43,"And the solar",58,"arrays are just",58,"charging up those",57,"batteries so every",58,"time they slip",58,"behind the",74,"Earth again",55,"and they're",55,"in nighttime,",55,"those batteries",55,"are just",55,"supplying power",55,"to everything.",236,"But",56,"it's",57,"100%",56,"solar,",57,"renewable,",56,"clean",57,"sun",56,"energy.",90,"Very true.",87,"It's all solar",60,"energy.",40,"And they're massive,",60,"right?",45,"Is it,",52,"I think",51,"it's, they",52,"actually, they're",52,"so big",51,"and they",52,"produce so",51,"much power",52,"that actually",79,"they do",53,"have to",53,"like kind",53,"of get",53,"rid of",53,"some of",53,"that power.",71,"Because it's kind",56,"of, it's a",55,"little bit redundant,",56,"right?",37,"Just in case",56,"one of them",56,"breaks, like you",56,"still have enough",56,"power to power",56,"the whole thing.",154,"You do have redundancy",64,"built in.",69,-1,0,"Redundancy is",75,"one of",75,"our favorite",75,"words.",69,"Redundancy is",62,"a fancy",62,"word for",62,"backup plan.",88,"And at",51,"NASA we",51,"always, you",51,"have backup",50,"plans for",51,"your backup",51,"plans.",49,"So yeah, even",69,"if you lose,",68,"we call them",70,"power channels.",68,"If you lose",68,"one, you lose",67,"two, you can",68,"still power the",67,"majority of all",68,"of your systems",104,"on board.",98,"And even",52,"going beyond",53,"that, if",53,"you lose,",52,"you know,",53,"a much",53,"larger amount",52,"of power,",53,"you can",78,"still power",51,"your key",51,"systems and",51,"everything.",58,"You might",65,"just power",65,"down other",66,"things temporarily",65,"while you",65,"fix the",65,"problem.",77,"But they",88,"generate pretty",89,"much a",88,"comparable amount",89,"to keep",88,"everything that",89,"we want",88,"on board.",169,"And that's all",75,"the life support,",74,"that's keeping the",75,"lights on, that's",74,"running all of",106,"the experiments",56,"on board,",56,"all of",56,"the different",56,"hardware, just",56,"keeping the",56,"station, you",56,"know, oriented",90,"in the",62,"right attitude",62,"and flying",62,"it at",62,"any time.",102,-1,0,"I mean,",81,"everything, everything,",81,"everything, everything.",110,"Everything's powered",57,"by the",57,"solar arrays.",90,"And I",64,"mean, it",65,"doesn't generate",64,"an overwhelming",65,"excess of",64,"energy by",65,"any means,",64,"because again,",87,"you are spending",66,"a lot of",65,"time in darkness.",95,"So those",58,"batteries are",57,"getting used",58,"pretty much",58,"constantly.",67,"We're in",76,"the process",76,"of swapping",77,"the batteries,",76,"we're upgrading.",126,"We've already",99,"upgraded one",99,"fourth of",99,"them.",85,"We switched",73,"out nickel",72,"hydrogen for",72,"lithium

all",66,"solar energy",66,"through those",66,"big, and",66,"they are",66,"very large.",95,"And we",58,"come back",58,"to the",59,"football field,",58,"the American",58,"football field",58,"analogy.",81,"We",51,"haven't",52,"clarified",51,"yet,",52,"have",51,"we?",86,-1,0,"That the",69,"solar arrays",68,"are basically,",69,"each solar",69,"array is",68,"the size",69,"of an",69,"end zone.",110,"And there",84,"are eight",83,"of those,",84,"yes, that",83,"are the",84,"size of",83,"an end",84,"zone.",72,"Thing like",62,"a pair",61,"of four",61,"of them.",110,"So it's",97,"tough because",97,"one pair",97,"is actually",97,"two array",97,"blankets, but",97,"they're very",97,"large.",99,"Yes.",100,"Yeah.",66,"Okay, so that's",50,"power, right?",55,"So we already",63,"talked about water,",64,"because you need",63,"to recycle water",64,"and make sure",63,"you have",70,"enough, and water",72,"is very expensive",72,"to launch.",78,"And if",60,"you recycle",60,"it, it's",60,"a lot",60,"more efficient",60,"and it's",60,"very, very",60,"clean.",67,"So what",75,"about air?",101,"That's one",50,"thing.",61,"You think",73,"about what",72,"a human",73,"needs, shelter,",73,"water, food.",106,"You didn't",67,"really think",66,"about air,",67,"but that's",67,"something you",66,"definitely need",67,"in space.",87,-1,0,"That's something we",61,"kind of take",62,"for granted.",69,"Air is",58,"just, it's",57,"air.",49,"It's everywhere down",60,"here.",55,"But up",70,"there, you're",70,"in a",70,"sealed environment.",103,"You're basically",66,"in a",66,"big sealed",66,"tin can,",66,"and you",66,"need to",66,"fill that",66,"with air.",104,"So we",76,"can launch",76,"air, just",77,"like we",76,"can launch",76,"water.",66,"You can",54,"launch a",54,"tank of",55,"super pressurized",54,"air, usually",54,"in its",55,"liquid form,",54,"and then",89,"feed it",70,"into the",69,"atmosphere.",74,"But the",79,"main way",80,"we get",79,"it is",79,"from water.",123,"We use",86,"a system",86,"called the",86,"oxygen generation",86,"system that",86,"actually takes",86,"water, splits",86,"the atom,",136,"splits the",93,"atom, but",93,"splits a",93,"water molecule",93,"into oxygen",93,"and hydrogen.",126,"And then",64,"we can",64,"take that",64,"oxygen and",64,"pump it",64,"into the",64,"atmosphere.",64,-1,0,"And they",64,"aren't in",65,"a pure",64,"oxygen atmosphere,",65,"so there's",64,"other stuff",65,"in there.",92,"There's a",55,"lot of",54,"nitrogen.",72,"So that...",110,"Very similar to",67,"Earth's

actually",120,"the",50,"same",51,"pressure,",50,"too.",108,"So",57,"there's",58,"no",57,"big",58,"difference",57,"there.",75,"That feeds into",53,"some of the",53,"stuff they have",53,"to do for",53,"spacewalks, but that's",53,"a completely different",135,"tangent I",99,"can go",100,"on.",76,"So we",54,"split the",53,"water molecules,",53,"so then",53,"you have",54,"your oxygen,",53,"which you",54,"can just",53,"feed directly",94,"back into",66,"the cabin,",68,"and then",66,"you have",67,"hydrogen, which",68,"you can",66,"vent overboard",93,"if you",51,"just build",51,"up a",51,"bunch of",51,"excess hydrogen.",90,"Or there's",80,"a process",80,"in a",79,"payload up",80,"there.",71,"It's used",62,"as more",62,"of a",62,"technology demonstration,",62,"so it's",62,"not really",62,"in the",62,"critical path,",62,"so it's",77,"not a critical",70,"piece that we",70,"have to have",70,"running at all",70,"times, but it's",70,"called the",90,"sabatier.",65,-1,0,"It uses",62,"the sabatier",62,"process, where",62,"you can",62,"take that",62,"hydrogen that",62,"you had",62,"left over",94,"from your",63,"water, and",63,"then you",63,"can take",64,"the carbon",63,"dioxide that",63,"gets scrubbed",63,"out of",63,"the atmosphere",112,"by a",80,"different device.",115,"You split",70,"that carbon",70,"dioxide, you",70,"now have",70,"oxygen, and",70,"then you",70,"have your",70,"leftover hydrogen.",95,"You combine those",75,"two, and you",74,"got more water.",105,"And so",62,"you can",61,"kind of",62,"build, the",61,"ideal is",62,"to build,",61,"we call",62,"it a",61,"closed loop.",100,"So everything",78,"that gets",78,"put into",78,"this life",78,"support loop,",78,"it's a",78,"big circle,",78,"just constantly",117,"gets recycled.",107,"You got",56,"your water,",57,"you drink",56,"your water,",57,"you recycle",56,"your water,",56,"you take",57,"some of",56,"that water,",86,"you turn",57,"it into",58,"air and",57,"oxygen, you",58,"take that",57,"excess hydrogen,",57,"you combine",58,"it with",81,"CO2 that",53,"the astronauts",53,"are breathing",53,"out, you",53,"make more",53,"water.",52,-1,0,"And so",50,"it's all",50,"just kind",51,"of constantly",50,"going around",50,"in a",50,"circle.",57,"And that",65,"way you",64,"get the",64,"absolute most",64,"out of",64,"everything you",64,"send up",64,"there.",65,"That's crazy.",103,"You actually",74,"have to",74,"create an",74,"atmosphere, right?",124,"Yes.",71,"Like Earth, where",63,"it kind of",63,"does it for",63,"us.",41,"You actually have",57,"to make it",56,"work.",53,"It's crazy.",83,"I like the",50,"Sabatier system.",67,"That's cool.",81,"He says it's a",57,"technology demonstration.",49,"I thought it",61,"was like part",61,"of the whole",62,"thing, because I",61,"know they called",61,"it a partially",84,"closed loop, because",66,"like you said,",66,"you can inject",67,"the hydrogen if",66,"you have too",66,"much, right?",160,"But it's",75,"kind of",75,"the same",75,"concept.",64,"So okay,",53,"so they",53,"have air,",53,"they have",53,"water, they",53,"have power,",53,"they have",53,"all kinds",53,"of stuff.",98,"So let's",88,"talk about",88,"some of",88,"the experiments.",123,"I know",70,"one of",70,"the biggest",71,"one is",70,"the experiment",70,"on themselves,",70,"right?",73,-1,0,"So in",74,"order to",74,"actually function",74,"beyond low",74,"Earth orbit",74,"and actually",74,"function in",74,"space, you",96,"have to",61,"learn how",59,"the human",61,"body reacts",60,"in space",59,"and what",61,"happens.",53,"So I think",69,"the biggest thing,",69,"maybe it's not",68,"the biggest thing,",70,"but it's definitely",69,"a very important",153,"is",54,"bone",54,"loss",53,"and",54,"muscle",54,"degradation,",54,"right?",85,"So that",65,"is if",63,"you're in",65,"space for",63,"too long",65,"and you're",63,"just kind",65,"of floating",63,"around, your",112,"bones start",95,"to exhibit",95,"symptoms of",95,"osteoporosis and",94,"your muscles",95,"start to",95,"degrade.",72,"So how do",74,"they counter that?",124,"Yeah.",90,"Well, when",82,"we talk",82,"research, there's",82,"really, there's",81,"kind of",82,"two different",82,"camps.",81,"There's the",80,"research that",80,"we're doing",80,"on board",80,"the station",80,"to get",80,"us ready",80,"to go",80,"on to",80,"Mars, or",83,"the solar system,",65,"all those other",65,"things, which is",65,"a lot of",65,"what you were",65,"just talking about.",169,-1,0,"And then",50,"there's the",50,"research that",50,"has direct",50,"applications on",50,"Earth.",55,"And we",63,"can dive",61,"into that",63,"too.",76,"But that's",91,"research flown",90,"by commercial",91,"companies, by",91,"academia, taking",90,"advantage of",91,"this microgravity",119,"environment because",58,"we've seen",57,"there's a",57,"lot you",58,"can learn",57,"by taking",58,"gravity out",57,"of the",118,"equation.",94,"But to",68,"the first",69,"camp, to",68,"the, you",69,"know, studying",68,"the people,",68,"the astronauts",69,"are guinea",68,"pigs kind",103,"of thing.",118,"The",50,"human",50,"body",50,"is",50,"an",50,"incredible",50,"machine",50,"and",50,"it's",50,"incredible",50,"at",50,"adapting",50,"to",50,"different",50,"environments.",92,"I mean,",84,"that's both",85,"a gift",84,"and a",84,"curse because",85,"when you",84,"go into",85,"outer space,",84,"I mean,",84,"your vestibular",89,"system, so your",69,"sense of, you",69,"know, up is",70,"down, down is",69,"up, your balance,",69,"all of",76,"that goes",53,"all out",52,"of whack.",78,-1,0,"But within",52,"about a",52,"day or",52,"two, most",51,"astronauts don't",52,"have the",52,"nausea anymore.",85,"Their body",66,"is used",67,"to it",66,"already and",67,"they're able",66,"to live",66,"and work,",67,"which that's",66,"incredible.",65,"That's a",62,"great advantage",62,"to just",62,"getting into",62,"a new",62,"environment and",62,"hitting the",62,"ground running.",90,"The problem",54,"with that",55,"is when",55,"you get",54,"to an",55,"environment where",54,"you have",55,"gravity again,",91,"hitting the",72,"ground running",73,"can be",72,"very problematic",73,"because your",72,"body, when",73,"it's not,",72,"when gravity",93,"is not pulling",59,"down on you.",88,"So you",54,"and I",54,"right now,",54,"I mean,",54,"gravity is",55,"pushing down",54,"on you",54,"at all",54,"times and",54,"that builds",80,"up muscles",52,"in your",53,"hips and",52,"bones in",52,"your hips.",84,"And that's",62,"why your",63,"legs are",63,"strong enough",62,"to just",63,"hold you",62,"upright because",63,"they're constantly",107,"fighting against",90,"that force.",134,"On places",88,"like the",89,"space station,",88,"that force",88,"disappears.",69,-1,0,"And so your",72,"body says, hmm,",73,"well, I don't",72,"need these muscles",72,"anymore.",59,"So it",68,"stops feeding",68,"nutrients to",68,"those.",75,"And so",83,"you can",83,"actually, astronauts",82,"will dispel,",83,"so in",83,"their urine,",83,"they'll get",83,"raised levels",115,"of calcium",64,"because their",65,"bones aren't",64,"needing it",65,"as much",64,"because their",65,"bones aren't",64,"getting that",115,"much force",82,"just by",82,"existing.",64,"They're getting rid",68,"of the calcium",68,"because the body's",68,"saying you don't",68,"need this anymore.",102,"And so",70,"understanding a",70,"lot of",70,"those processes",70,"is important",70,"because, I",70,"mean, if",70,"the astronauts",95,"were just",50,"going to",50,"stay in",50,"microgravity forever,",51,"not that",50,"big of",50,"a deal",50,"because their",50,"body just",104,"adapts and",78,"I mean,",78,"they become",78,"space people.",114,"But astronauts",72,"come back",73,"to Earth.",95,"Astronauts will walk",69,"on Mars where",69,"there is gravity,",69,"less gravity, but",69,"still gravity.",67,-1,0,"And you're going",65,"to need to",64,"walk around in",65,"a pretty heavy",65,"space suit and",64,"things like that.",179,"So finding",71,"ways to",71,"counteract, we",71,"call them",71,"countermeasures for",71,"all the",71,"ways the",71,"body adapts",90,"is, it's",55,"something that",54,"we've been",55,"doing pretty",54,"much as",55,"long as",55,"we've been",54,"doing space",125,"flight, but",98,"we've really",98,"aggressively pursued",97,"it on",98,"board the",98,"space station.",136,"So for",78,"example, bone",77,"loss and",78,"muscle loss,",77,"we've actually",78,"pretty much",77,"reversed for",78,"the most",94,"part, all",55,"of the",55,"bone loss",56,"and muscle",55,"loss.",56,"You'll still",58,"see changes",57,"in bone",58,"density in",57,"some of",58,"the crew",57,"members, but",58,"a lot",57,"of them",87,"aren't losing",60,"that bone",59,"mass, that",60,"muscle mass",59,"that was",60,"such a",59,"problem in",60,"early long",113,"duration",53,"space",53,"flight.",81,"And we",57,"do that",57,"through exercise.",100,-1,0,"That is",84,"the main",84,"driver.",81,"There's exercise",79,"and there's",78,"nutrition.",67,"And exercise,",54,"the crew",55,"members are",54,"working out",54,"about two",55,"hours every",54,"single day.",79,"I don't know",72,"about you, but",72,"I don't work",72,"out two hours",72,"every single day.",105,"30 minutes,",66,"I'm pretty",66,"much telling",66,"you.",55,"Even that can",67,"be hard for",67,"some people to",67,"find, but the",67,"crew members, two",67,"hours every single",135,"day",68,"and",69,"that's",68,"exercise,",69,"both",68,"cardio",69,"and",68,"resistance.",97,"So they",57,"have a",57,"number of",56,"devices up",57,"there.",57,"They have",58,"a treadmill,",58,"which again,",58,"you need",58,"to remember",58,"everything, and",58,"this is",58,"the running",96,"theme, everything",78,"we do",77,"in microgravity",77,"is different.",100,"So you can't",68,"just hop on",68,"a treadmill, you'll",68,"just float away",68,"and you'll just",68,"be pumping your",103,"legs in",57,"microgravity and",58,"that does",57,"nothing for",58,"you.",63,"So the",68,"treadmill actually",68,"has a",68,"harness with",68,"basically bungee",68,"cables that",68,"pulls them",68,"down towards",117,"the treadmill.",110,-1,0,"So that",54,"way you're",54,"getting the",54,"force in",55,"your legs,",54,"you're actually",54,"exerting more",54,"force and",92,"you can",64,"run.",52,"It's the closest",60,"you can get",60,"to just running",60,"in space.",67,"I mean,",55,"we've had",55,"astronauts run",55,"marathons on",55,"the treadmill",55,"and that's",55,"one of",55,"their key",106,"devices.",86,"They also",72,"have something",72,"called the",72,"Advanced Resistive",72,"Exercise Device.",104,"I've stayed",65,"away from",65,"acronyms as",65,"much as",65,"possible so",65,"far, but",65,"they inevitably",65,"come up,",110,"we call",77,"it ARED,",77,"and it's",77,"basically their",77,"home gym",77,"on board",77,"the station.",101,"Now again, you",73,"can't just pick",73,"up a heavy",74,"weight and do",73,"some curls and",73,"get a workout.",90,"It doesn't work",50,"like that.",45,"Wait, this thing makes no",55,"sense in microgravity.",71,"Yeah, there's",75,"microgravity.",69,"So I",62,"mean, they",62,"literally move",63,"several hundred",62,"pound modules",62,"and pieces",63,"of hardware",62,"all the",131,"time.",105,"And so",75,"to help",74,"simulate weightlifting,",75,"it actually",75,"uses a",74,"series of",75,"pneumatic tubes",128,"to",53,"simulate",53,"force.",85,-1,0,"And they",65,"can actually",64,"simulate up",65,"to 600",65,"pounds of",64,"force.",66,"Which some",68,"of the",68,"astronauts, their",68,"squat number",67,"goes up",68,"when they're",68,"up there.",88,"And it's slightly",61,"misleading because they're",60,"not squatting their",61,"own body weight",61,"like they are",116,"here on",75,"Earth.",53,"It's still 600 pounds,",60,"I don't think I",60,"can do that.",67,"Well, I don't",67,"think any of",66,"them do 600",67,"pounds, but they",67,"have the option",67,"if we ever",67,"get some power",115,"lifters up",70,"on board",70,"the station.",100,"And then",62,"they also",61,"have a",61,"stationary bicycle.",86,"And then there's",74,"another treadmill.",78,"So there's",56,"actually, well,",56,"there's two",56,"treadmills on",56,"board the",56,"station.",64,"But I",72,"mean, they",72,"use all",72,"those two",72,"hours a",72,"day, and",72,"that's just",72,"to maintain",72,"that bone",144,"and",72,"muscle.",107,"And there's",72,"also ways",71,"you can",72,"help that",71,"process through",72,"nutrition, we're",71,"constantly looking,",93,"is there a",66,"better way for",65,"them to work",66,"out?",47,-1,0,"Should they",50,"do?",55,"I mean,",60,"there's something,",61,"there are",60,"research projects",61,"like Sprint,",60,"where does",61,"it make",60,"sense for",94,"them to",64,"work out",63,"a lot",64,"harder, but",63,"for a",64,"shorter amount",63,"of time.",100,"High intensity",72,"interval?",86,"Yeah.",76,"Because two",53,"hours is",53,"a long",53,"time every",53,"single day.",99,"That's a",91,"lot to",90,"ask.",70,"And crew time",72,"is very valuable,",72,"right?",51,"Because they,",54,"I mean,",54,"you're talking",54,"about, like",54,"you said,",54,"200, I",54,"think it's",54,"200 experiments",85,"per increment,",63,"right?",55,"And astronauts",50,"are- 250",129,"is",53,"the",52,"usual",52,"number.",85,"And like",67,"a six",66,"month span,",67,"250 experiments",67,"will happen",66,"on board",67,"the station.",100,"That's crazy.",87,"So yeah, crew",60,"time is very",59,"valuable.",65,"And that's",90,"two hours",90,"gone every",90,"day from",89,"experiment time,",90,"just to",90,"maintain bone",90,"and muscle",90,"mass.",95,-1,0,"Yep.",100,"Wow.",81,"And that's",64,"just one",63,"part of",63,"what changes",64,"when you're",63,"in microgravity.",97,"Oh yeah.",97,"I mean,",61,"your body",60,"actually has",61,"less blood",61,"in it",60,"by the",61,"time you",61,"come home.",92,"Your heart",62,"can change",62,"sizes because",62,"it doesn't",62,"work as",62,"hard to",62,"pump the",62,"blood.",84,"And",53,"then",53,"one",54,"of",53,"the",53,"big",53,"outstanding",54,"ones",53,"that",53,"we're",53,"still",54,"addressing",53,"is",53,"vision",53,"changes.",110,"And",57,"that's",56,"something",56,"that",57,"we",57,"knew",56,"about,",57,"but",56,"was",57,"never",56,"really",57,"considered",56,"a",56,"huge",57,"deal.",91,"Not a",69,"huge deal,",69,"but never",70,"really considered",69,"a major",69,"impact until",69,"within the",69,"last couple",101,"of years",64,"when we",63,"had a",64,"significant amount",63,"of astronauts",64,"returning from",63,"these really",108,"long stays",90,"in space",90,"and reporting",91,"that their",90,"vision was",90,"worse.",66,-1,0,"And it's normal",63,"to come back",63,"to Earth and",63,"have a couple",63,"of changes that",63,"linger for a",97,"little while.",89,"But for these",68,"crew members, the",67,"vision never got",68,"better.",73,"Wow.",69,"And that's a",61,"concern.",44,"If you send",73,"somebody to Mars",73,"and in the",74,"nine months or",73,"however long it",73,"ends up taking",73,"to get",90,"there, all",65,"of a",66,"sudden they",65,"go from",65,"20-20 to",65,"needing glasses,",66,"to needing",65,"even stronger",95,"glasses that",60,"they don't",59,"have available",60,"and they",59,"land on",60,"Mars and",59,"they can't",60,"see.",49,"That's a big",61,"issue.",39,"That's a big",61,"one.",51,"And so",64,"we're trying",63,"to figure",63,"out exactly",63,"why this",64,"happens.",65,"There's a",67,"number of",66,"good ideas,",67,"good hypotheses",67,"we think",66,"we know,",67,"but we're",67,"still doing",66,"a lot",87,"of tests",54,"to figure",54,"out exactly",54,"why it",54,"happens.",61,"And just",68,"like the",68,"bone and",68,"muscle, how",69,"do we",68,"stop that",68,"from happening?",93,-1,0,"So you got",73,"to find those",73,"countermeasures to make",73,"that happen.",99,"Wow.",75,"That's really",50,"intense.",55,"I mean,",60,"imagine landing",60,"on Mars",60,"and you",60,"can't see",59,"anything.",71,"It'd be",81,"kind of",81,"a buzzkill.",120,"Travel 60",76,"million miles",76,"and get",77,"out and",76,"everything's blurry.",102,"It wouldn't",51,"make me",50,"happy.",55,"So I",59,"know like",60,"when, here's",59,"another thing,",59,"when astronauts,",59,"so astronauts",59,"now they're",91,"doing on",62,"the International",63,"Space Station,",62,"pretty regularly",63,"they're doing",62,"long duration",98,"increments, right?",103,"So they're",65,"doing six",65,"months at",65,"a time.",86,"So this is",64,"longer than any",63,"of the shuttle",64,"missions or a",64,"lot of the",64,"missions before it.",110,"And it's",94,"all to",94,"practice for",95,"missions beyond",94,"low Earth",94,"orbit.",75,"But when",58,"they come",58,"back to",57,"Earth, right,",58,"they generally",58,"right now",57,"they come",58,"back in",58,"a Soyuz,",85,"land in",54,"Kazakhstan, and",55,"then we",54,"have recovery",55,"teams that",54,"go out",55,"and get",54,"them.",54,-1,0,"But they",54,"have a",53,"hard time",53,"walking, right?",87,"When they",67,"first get",66,"out.",67,"Some do.",111,"And so",90,"that's part",90,"of, again,",90,"the human",90,"body reacting",90,"to the",90,"different environments.",116,"When astronauts",53,"first get",54,"into space,",53,"some will",53,"have nausea,",53,"some will",54,"have some",53,"adverse reactions",99,"to being",73,"in microgravity.",94,"The same is",65,"true when you're",65,"in microgravity for",64,"a really long",65,"time and you",65,"come back down",90,"to Earth,",52,"all of",51,"a sudden",52,"there's this",51,"huge weight",52,"pressing down",52,"on you",51,"that hasn't",52,"been there",93,"for the",67,"last six",67,"months or",67,"however long",67,"you were",67,"there.",66,"Your inner",63,"ear goes",64,"crazy and",65,"like, oh,",64,"all the",63,"fluid's pulling",65,"down again.",89,"Where am",50,"I?",45,"There used to",60,"be no up",61,"and down, but",61,"now all of",60,"a sudden there's",61,"definitely a down.",101,"And so",82,"it can",81,"be tough",82,"just to",82,"walk.",80,-1,0,"I mean,",80,"we have",79,"teams that",80,"pretty much",80,"carry the",79,"astronauts out",80,"of the",79,"spacecraft and",80,"then onto",91,"a medical",51,"tent.",56,"So we",62,"try to",61,"minimize any",62,"of that",61,"real discomfort",62,"and things",61,"like that",62,"for these",61,"crew members.",95,"But they",66,"are still",66,"test subjects",66,"and so",66,"we still",66,"do stuff",66,"to them.",97,"And part",62,"of that",63,"is, let's",62,"say you're",61,"the first",62,"person to",63,"go to",62,"Mars.",50,"When you land,",57,"there's not going",56,"to be anybody",58,"there to pull",57,"you out of",56,"your capsule or",58,"help you",69,"set up",51,"camp or",51,"anything like",50,"that.",45,"I'm on my",61,"own.",40,"You're on your",63,"own.",57,"And so",72,"we need",73,"to make",72,"sure before",72,"we send",73,"somebody, how",72,"much can",73,"they do",72,"on their",72,"own?",58,"And we have",63,"these crew members",64,"coming back from",63,"extended periods in",64,"space and we",63,"have the",92,"ability to",71,"test them.",121,-1,0,"And",50,"now",51,"every",50,"astronaut",50,"is",51,"an",50,"incredibly",50,"gracious",51,"person",50,"because",50,"a",51,"lot",50,"of",50,"this",51,"testing",50,"isn't",101,"glamorous.",83,"Oh yeah.",99,"You use",65,"the word",65,"guinea pig.",97,"They are",62,"guinea pigs",62,"in almost",62,"every sense",62,"of the",62,"word where",62,"they are",62,"subjecting themselves",97,"to

started doing",66,"within the last couple",66,"of years is called",91,"the field",50,"test.",54,"So they'll",58,"come home,",57,"they'll land",57,"in the",58,"middle of",57,"Kazakhstan, pull",58,"them out",57,"of the",96,"capsule and",76,"then we",77,"subject them",76,"to a",77,"series of,",76,"they sound",76,"really simple,",77,"but it's",76,"just functional",124,"tests and",86,"it's things",86,"like walking",86,"a straight",86,"line, sitting",86,"down and",86,"standing up,",112,"laying down",70,"and standing",69,"up, standing",70,"up and",70,"having somebody",69,"push you",70,"a little",70,"bit.",71,-1,0,"It's all",74,"these things",74,"that, you",74,"know, that",73,"sounds, that",74,"sounds really",74,"easy.",53,"Like can I",50,"stand up?",50,"I could be",50,"an
