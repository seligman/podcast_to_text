and",68,"I'll be",68,"your host",68,"today.",67,-1,0,"So on",67,"this podcast",67,"we'll be",67,"bringing in",67,"the experts,",67,"NASA scientists",67,"and engineers,",67,"astronauts, pretty",76,"much all the",65,"folks that have",64,"the coolest information,",64,"the stuff you",64,"really want to",90,"know right",51,"on the",50,"show and",51,"tell you",51,"more about",50,"all things",51,"in NASA.",51,"We're talking",50,"everything from",84,"extraterrestrial dirt",59,"to the",59,"unknown parts",59,"of the",59,"universe.",29,"So today",59,"on the",59,"first episode",93,"we're talking",68,"International Space",69,"Station with",69,"Dan Hewitt.",68,"He's the",69,"public affairs",68,"officer for",87,"the Space",52,"Station program",53,"here at",52,"the NASA",53,"Johnson Space",52,"Center in",53,"Houston, Texas.",52,"And we",77,"had a great",75,"discussion about what",74,"the International Space",75,"Station is, how",74,"it works, what",75,"it's made of,",99,"and why it's",73,"there.",25,"So with no",73,"further delay, let's",73,"go light speed",73,"and jump right",73,"ahead to our",245,"talk",171,"with",172,"Mr.",171,-1,0,"Dan",172,"Hewitt.",171,"Enjoy.",284,-1,0,"So",113,"anyway,",113,"let's",113,"begin.",113,"I",113,"figured",113,"you're",113,"the",113,"perfect",112,"person",113,"to",113,"have",113,"here",113,"being",113,"the",113,"public",113,"affairs",151,"officer of",78,"the International",77,"Space Station.",78,"You talk",77,"to scientists,",78,"astronauts, engineers,",108,"constantly.",31,"So you're",61,"very aware",61,"of what's",61,"going on",61,"and everything",61,"about the",61,"space station.",87,-1,0,"So for",52,"those of",52,"you listening,",52,"I think",52,"this is",52,"a good",52,"opportunity to",52,"learn just",52,"everything about",52,"it.",62,-1,0,"So start",74,"from the",74,"very beginning.",74,"What is",74,"it?",36,"Everything.",37,"Awesome.",37,"Well, to",74,"start in",74,"the beginning.",109,-1,0,"No.",35,"So the",70,"space station",70,"is it's",70,"a giant",71,"spaceship.",35,"I mean,",70,"it is",70,"the largest",70,"spacecraft that",104,"humans have",68,"ever built.",67,"And we",69,"haven't been",68,"flying in",68,"space for",67,"too long",69,"relatively.",34,"I mean,",68,"we've been",82,"up there for",73,"50 or 60",73,"years.",25,"But the space",73,"station is kind",73,"of the pinnacle",73,"for what we've",73,"built so far.",103,-1,0,"It is",62,"massive.",31,"I mean,",61,"this thing",62,"supports multiple",62,"people.",30,"It's been",62,"up there",62,"at least",61,"pieces of",62,"it since",95,"1998.",32,"So that's",64,"another one",64,"of those",64,"factoid alerts",64,"that we",64,"always like",64,"to tell",64,"people.",65,-1,0,"If you",67,"were born",68,"after the",67,"year 1998,",67,"the spacecraft's",67,"always been",67,"up there.",68,"But if",67,"you were",67,"born after",101,"the year,",68,"after November",67,"of 2000,",68,"as long",67,"as you've",68,"been alive,",67,"human beings",68,"have been",104,"living and",72,"working in",73,"space.",36,"Wow.",36,"We are",72,"aliens.",37,"We are",72,"a space-faring",72,"species.",37,"We are",72,"the ones",103,"off the",61,"planet.",30,"We've had",61,"people up",61,"there every",61,"single day",60,"for, as",61,"of right",61,"now, over",61,"16 years.",93,-1,0,"I mean,",66,"that is",65,"mind-blowing.",33,"And they're",66,"doing stuff",66,"every single",65,"day.",33,"It's either",66,"going to",65,"impact us",66,"here on",82,"Earth or get",74,"us ready to",74,"go further out.",74,"I mean, that",74,"is the purpose",74,"of the space",74,"station.",25,"That's why it's",110,"up there.",61,"That's why",61,"we have",61,"this huge",61,"thing floating",60,"above us.",61,"So you",61,"say stuff.",61,"We're doing",83,"stuff every day.",65,"Obviously, living up",66,"there, I think",66,"is like a",67,"big part of",66,"it, right?",44,"Where we're like",98,"you said,",55,"where explorers,",54,"where space",55,"fairs, what",54,"is the",55,"stuff that's",55,"actually, you",54,"know, that",71,"has that impact?",64,"It's a lot",65,"of stuff.",43,"It's a lot",65,"of stuff.",43,"I mean, it",65,"is, it is,",64,"and it's divided",97,"up.",27,"It is,",54,"is simple",54,"as just",54,"living in",54,"space.",26,"So just",54,"everything you",54,"do in",54,"space is",54,"a little",77,"bit different than",71,"the way you",71,"do it down",71,"here on Earth.",71,"I mean, it",70,"could be anything",71,"from going to",95,"the bathroom, to",70,"how you eat,",71,"to just how",70,"you get your",71,"water, everything's different.",160,-1,0,"So it's",50,"like a",51,"way to",50,"practice, really.",51,"It is",50,"for things",51,"further out,",50,"because it's",51,"not really",74,"far up, right?",71,"It's only 250",71,"miles.",23,"If you think",71,"about it, we're",71,"still in the",70,"Earth's protection.",73,-1,0,"I mean,",50,"like, oh,",51,"it's still",50,"protected by",51,"the Earth's",50,"magnetic field.",51,"Well, space",50,"is funny",51,"in that,",89,"going up,",78,"it feels",77,"like it's",78,"so far",77,"away space,",78,"but it's",77,"250 miles.",78,"That's not",77,"that far.",106,-1,0,"I mean,",58,"I feel",58,"like the",58,"city of",57,"Houston is",58,"250 miles.",58,"It's not,",58,"but I",57,"mean, 250",58,"miles on",58,"a car",91,"is a",66,"short road",67,"trip, but",66,"250 miles",67,"straight up,",66,"that's a",67,"rocket ride.",66,"It's a",67,"slightly different",96,"road trip,",60,"but it",59,"isn't that",60,"far away.",59,"I mean,",59,"we still",60,"kind of",59,"are right",60,"in the",59,"doorstep.",30,"There's there's",233,"a",55,"really",54,"great",53,"quote",55,"in",54,"the",54,"the",53,"the",54,"paramount",55,"of",53,"space",54,"movies,",55,"Armageddon,",53,"where",77,"our home scene",65,"says, you know,",67,"we're not even",65,"out in outer",67,"space yet.",44,"This is just",66,"like the beginning.",97,"And that's",53,"kind of",53,"where the",53,"station is.",53,"It's in",53,"space.",26,"It's in",53,"what we",53,"call lower",78,"or a door,",75,"but so it's",74,"still pretty close.",75,"I mean, they",74,"could get in",74,"the so you",75,"spacecraft and",76,"be back",51,"on the",51,"ground inside",51,"a couple",51,"of hours.",51,-1,0,"So, I",51,"mean, you're",51,"still right",51,"in the",51,"doorstep.",53,-1,0,"You're not",55,"really way",55,"out there",55,"yet, but",55,"it's getting",56,"us ready",55,"to go",55,"way out",55,"there.",51,-1,0,"Well, that's the",72,"whole so NASA",72,"describes it as",72,"Earth's reliant, right?",72,"So, I kind",72,"of like the",100,"way they",55,"section it",54,"off, right?",55,"Earth's reliant",55,"means exactly",55,"what you",54,"said, right?",55,"So, something",55,"goes wrong.",86,-1,0,"You can",63,"just hop",63,"into spacecraft",64,"and be",63,"home in",63,"three hours.",63,"And it's",64,"easy to",63,"get stuff",63,"there, because",74,"it's only, I",64,"mean, some Soyuz",64,"rice have been",64,"as little as",64,"like six hours,",64,"right?",54,-1,0,"Relatively easy.",66,"Relatively.",32,"Go into",66,"space.",33,"It's really",65,"rocket science.",94,-1,0,"Don't want",56,"to trivialize",57,"it.",28,"It's still",56,"and even",57,"that's even",56,"after it",57,"managed myself.",56,"It's still",77,"not easy to",74,"go to space.",73,"It's still, I",73,"mean, it is",73,"rocket science.",49,"It's literal rocket",73,"science.",63,-1,0,"Right.",39,"Hugely complex",78,"and there's",78,"always inherent",77,"risk and",78,"all these",78,"other things.",124,-1,0,"But when",95,"you start",93,"comparing it",95,"to going",93,"to Mars",95,"or our",93,"far-flung aspirations",95,"of spreading",113,"throughout the",67,"solar system",67,"and the",67,"galaxy and",67,"everything, when",66,"you compare",67,"it to",67,"that, it's",139,"doing",53,"hand",53,"quotes",53,"easy.",53,"But",53,"it's",53,"still",53,"a",53,"monumental",53,"undertaking.",53,"Yeah.",78,-1,0,"And that's",50,"why, so",50,"we're doing",51,"that.",25,"Just like",50,"you said,",50,"in the",51,"future, we",50,"want to",50,"go farther,",50,"right?",47,-1,0,"So we want",65,"to go to",65,"Mars.",21,"We want to",65,"really just expand",65,"our presence in",65,"the solar system.",96,-1,0,"So the",63,"international space",63,"station is",64,"a great",63,"way to",63,"practice that.",63,"It's a",63,"good, like",63,"you have",86,"a good understanding",66,"of what it",67,"takes to live",66,"in space.",45,"To operate in",66,"space, you could",67,"do a ton",66,"of science",82,"and learn",60,"how things",59,"interact and",60,"then if",59,"you learn",60,"how things",59,"interact, you",60,"can design",86,"better systems",52,"to make",52,"them work",52,"better.",26,"I think",52,"one of",52,"the ones,",52,"I think",52,"capillary action.",52,"I think",84,"was a",64,"great one.",64,"The way",64,"that fluid's",64,"moved in",64,"space is",64,"kind of",64,"cool because",64,"they sort",64,"of like",90,"create a",52,"ball and",53,"there's no",52,"down.",26,"So if",53,"you're trying",52,"to design",53,"like a",52,"system that",224,"like a",54,"rocket system",55,"in order",54,"to propel",54,"fuel, you",55,"need to",54,"fuel isn't",55,"going to",54,"go down,",54,"right?",56,-1,0,"You kind",57,"of need",57,"to have",56,"that sort",57,"of capillary",57,"action and",57,"a path",57,"to get",56,"there.",29,"Those little",79,"tiny things are",66,"things that make",66,"the huge difference",66,"and being able",66,"to kind of",66,"exploit the solar",66,"system.",59,-1,0,"Little comes",75,"to down",75,"to gravity",75,"and that's",75,"kind of",75,"the ultimate",75,"differentiator between",75,"why everything",78,"we do in",60,"outer space is",61,"different from the",61,"way we do",60,"it on earth.",61,"Totally.",20,"Some of the",105,"stuff you",88,"touch on",88,"is very",88,"apt.",44,"I mean,",88,"just moving",88,"fluids where,",88,"you know,",88,"here on",88,"earth, we",112,"almost take it",75,"for granted that",75,"everything settles towards",75,"the bottom.",50,"So plumbing systems",75,"and everything you",100,"can use",51,"that to",51,"your advantage",50,"and space,",51,"you don't",51,"have that.",50,"And that",51,"affects everything",77,"from moving",54,"rocket fuel",53,"to, you",53,"know, I'm",54,"an astronaut",53,"and I",53,"need to",54,"get to",53,"drink a",53,"water.",27,"Well, that",101,"system has",75,"to be",75,"specifically designed",74,"to work",75,"in the",75,"absence of",74,"gravity.",38,"Yeah.",37,"And we've",103,"had a",57,"lot of",57,"practice, you",57,"know, since",57,"we've been",56,"flying in",57,"space, since",57,"since the",57,"60s.",121,-1,0,"But the",72,"station is",73,"really the",72,"first place",72,"you've had",73,"on this",72,"scale.",36,"There have",73,"been space",72,"stations in",118,"the past,",82,"both from",81,"the US",82,"and Russia.",82,"But the",81,"space station",82,"is really",81,"the modern",82,"cutting edge",124,"test bed",84,"for just",84,"doing and",84,"learning everything",84,"about living",85,"in space.",84,"And so",84,"you have",84,"all of",119,"these different",69,"technologies that,",69,"like I",69,"said earlier,",69,"everything you",69,"do in",69,"space is",69,"different from",95,"the way",61,"that you",60,"do it",61,"on planet",61,"earth, where,",60,"you know,",61,"you have",61,"oxygen thanks",60,"to natural",146,"cycles in",83,"the of",83,"trees, scrubbing",83,"carbon dioxide",83,"from your",83,"atmosphere and",83,"producing oxygen",118,"back for",72,"you.",36,"You have",71,"water and",72,"lakes, reservoirs",71,"coming literally",72,"raining down",72,"on you",71,"from the",72,"sky where",99,"in space",63,"none of",63,"that exists.",64,-1,0,"Yes, you",63,"either have",63,"to bring",63,"it with",64,"you or",63,"find a",63,"way to",90,"create it.",54,"Yeah.",27,"And that's",54,"something that",54,"we're doing",54,"on the",54,"station right",54,"now where",54,"you're trying",54,"to and",90,"that's one",65,"of those",64,"key, we",64,"always talk",64,"about the",64,"different technologies",64,"that you",64,"need and",100,"technologies that",74,"really broad",74,"term.",37,"But one",74,"of the",73,"ones that",74,"is a",74,"lot, probably",74,"easier to",106,"understand is",65,"how we",64,"get those",65,"things, how",65,"you get",65,"the water,",64,"how you",65,"get the",65,"air just",65,"for the",96,"crew members.",62,"And one",63,"of the",62,"things you",63,"got to",62,"remember is",63,"again, so",62,"we're close",63,"to earth",62,"right now.",88,-1,0,"So we",50,"can launch",51,"water, we",50,"can launch",50,"air, we",51,"can launch",50,"all these",51,"things.",25,"So these",50,"crew members",86,"but when",70,"they go",71,"to Mars,",70,"there's no",70,"resupply ship.",71,"There's no,",70,"you know,",70,"hey, the",71,"water tanks",70,"get low,",99,"let's stop",63,"off here",63,"and tap",64,"it off.",63,"You can't",63,"do that.",63,"So you've",64,"got to",63,"bring everything",63,"with you",163,"and everything",54,"is heavy.",55,"So the",54,"more stuff",54,"you bring",55,"with you,",54,"the more",54,"fuel you",55,"need, the",54,"more expensive",63,"you're mission, and",53,"it just kind",53,"of compounds on",54,"and on and",53,"on and on",53,"and on and",53,"on and on.",75,-1,0,"And I'm gonna",66,"ramble here for",66,"a while because",65,"I'd love this",66,"subject.",22,"Okay, well I'll",66,"kind of, I'm",88,"not gonna stop",66,"you.",23,"I'm gonna kind",66,"of read, like",67,"read for you.",66,"Okay.",22,"One of the",67,"things on the",95,"International Space",56,"Station, they're",57,"doing now",56,"to do",57,"exactly that.",56,"So you",57,"said things",56,"are heavy,",87,"right?",30,"Water, water",61,"especially is",60,"very heavy.",61,"Yes.",30,"I forget",61,"the costs",61,"per pound",60,"to order",61,"in order",91,"to launch.",60,"Always varies.",61,"Always varies.",61,"Okay, that's",60,"good to",61,"know.",30,"But I",61,"know the",61,"one way",60,"they're actually",103,"doing like",71,"helping that",73,"out for",72,"long duration",72,"missions is",72,"recycling and",72,"the recycling",98,"system is",53,"just top",54,"notch.",27,"So good",53,"that they",53,"actually brought",53,"the technology",54,"back down",53,"to Earth",80,"and then",53,"actually helping",53,"out third",53,"world countries",53,"with, you",53,"know, not",53,"access to",53,"any kind",53,"of clean",84,"drinking water.",60,"It's like",60,"the filtration",60,"system is",61,"that good.",60,"They drink",60,"their own",60,"urine and",95,"capture sweat",69,"and stuff",69,"like that,",69,"right?",35,-1,0,"They do.",69,"And that's,",69,"that's always",69,"a fun,",92,"it'll moment.",47,"It'll kill kids",71,"and stuff when",71,"you tell them",70,"that.",24,"But and there's,",70,"there's the famous",126,"astronaut saying",78,"that yesterday's",78,"coffee is",78,"tomorrow's coffee",78,"to where",78,"that's what",78,"you have",101,"to do when",69,"you have these",69,"weight limits and",69,"you're in this",69,"environment where, you",69,"know, outside",87,"your four",63,"metal walls",63,"is just",63,"a vacuum",63,"of nothingness.",63,"You have",63,"to find",63,"ways to",92,"conserve all",57,"those things",57,"and we",57,"know very",57,"well here",57,"on planet",57,"Earth that",57,"conservation is",157,"a very",65,"important facet",65,"of

with",96,"you.",28,"And so",58,"to recycle",57,"the water,",57,"they actually,",57,"and they",58,"do, they",57,"collect water",57,"from all",93,"different sources,",71,"whether it's",71,"the

percentages",85,"seem to",84,"vary that",85,"I mean,",85,"we're reclaiming",84,"at least",85,"85% of",161,"the astronauts",78,"urine back",78,"into potable",78,"water.",39,"So drinkable",78,"water.",39,-1,0,"I mean,",78,"that's incredible.",172,-1,0,"And as",76,"you alluded",76,"to, we've",76,"actually taken",77,"that water",76,"recycling technology",76,"and made",76,"it

up",64,"having a",64,"use there.",64,"And that's,",64,"we call",64,"them spin-offs.",89,-1,0,"And that's,",51,"you know,",50,"there's a",51,"lot of",51,"famous ones",50,"throughout

there's a",70,"lot of them,",71,"right?",24,"There's like memory",70,"foam is another",71,"one and like",97,"insulation for",54,"your house,",54,"stuff like",54,"that.",27,"Like that",54,"all that's",54,"there's a",54,"lot.",27,"And we,",54,"we produce",87,"something called",66,"spin-offs magazine",66,"where, I",66,"mean, it",66,"goes through",66,"just about",66,"every

about",60,"all like",60,"all the",60,"experiments and",60,"like the",59,"reason that",60,"we're up",60,"there, who's",60,"up there",86,"right now?",53,"So you",54,"say like,",53,"you know,",53,"if

two",78,"Americans, right?",79,"Yeah.",39,"So international",78,"is the",78,"first word",79,"in the",78,"name of",78,"the station.",104,"It's an",64,"international space",64,"station.",32,"So there's",64,"always an",64,"international crew",64,"up there.",97,-1,0,"So right",66,"now there's",66,"two Americans,",66,"Peggy Wetz",66,"and then",66,"Shane Kimbro,",66,"one French",66,"astronaut,

number,",57,"but I",58,"mean countries",58,"all over",57,"the globe",58,"have flown",67,"crew members on",57,"board the space",57,"station.",19,"Oh yeah, I",57,"want to say",57,"that.",19,"I think it's",57,"the number of",121,"18 as",83,"the latest",83,"and you've",82,"had well",83,"over 200",83,"individuals travel",82,"to the",83,"space station.",190,-1,0,"And it",70,"is this",71,"global

that",89,"future missions,",90,"there's a",89,"lot of",90,"reasons to",89,"increase

can",66,"a lot",67,"of times",66,"be a",67,"major driver.",66,"Going to",66,"Mars and",94,"going to",61,"other places",61,"is going",61,"to be",61,"very expensive.",61,"And so",61,"it makes",61,"a lot",61,"more sense",61,"to shoulder",113,"that burden",83,"across several",83,"countries who",83,"all have",83,"this kind",82,"of shared",83,"interest will",83,"probably have",100,"different

we",65,"all have",65,"that common",65,"goal of",65,"exploring space",227,"improving the",52,"situation for",53,"people back",52,"here on",53,"earth and",52,"trying to",52,"push out",53,"further into",52,"the

I",66,"think one of",67,"my favorite things",67,"really when you",66,"think about gold",67,"participation is the",248,"way that",75,"the modules",75,"are designed.",75,"Each of",75,"them were",75,"just given",75,"specific specifications,",97,"this is how",67,"it needs to",68,"be built and",67,"they built them",68,"all over the",67,"world and then",68,"launched them up",88,"into space and",66,"connected them for",66,"the first time",65,"in space.",44,"Really everyone had",66,"to be working",87,"to get that",63,"constantly to make",63,"sure that that",63,"actually happened.",42,"And then if",63,"the launch in",63,"this space,",64,"then you have",64,"to connect it",64,"in space.",43,"Make sure it",64,"works, make sure",64,"all the systems",64,"are integrated.",72,-1,0,"That's crazy!",58,"It is!",58,"And again,",58,"that comes",58,"back to",58,"you have",58,"these countries",58,"with, I",157,"mean, English",72,"barriers and",72,"just completely",72,"different ways",72,"of engineering",72,"and everything,",102,"but we",61,"built the",61,"station piece",61,"by piece",61,"in outer",61,"space.",31,"Like you",61,"just said,",82,"none of these",65,"things were connected",65,"on the ground",65,"the first time.",64,"So you better",65,"make sure that",65,"when you",69,"set it up",71,"to space, it's",71,"going to like,",71,"you didn't build",71,"a square peg",71,"for a round",71,"hole kind of",102,"thing.",33,"Yeah.",32,"So we",63,"had, there",65,"are definitely",64,"ways to",64,"share that",64,"knowledge, to",64,"share the",64,"technology, to",113,"make sure",82,"that all",82,"of your,",81,"you know,",82,"you can",82,"agree on",81,"standards, essentially",82,"to make",82,"sure everything",95,"talks to",55,"each other,",56,"all the",55,"different electronics,",55,"or all",55,"the different",55,"structural systems,",88,"all of",66,"these different",67,"things.",33,-1,0,"But it",66,"was still",67,"monumental to,",66,"to build",66,"this piece",67,"by piece.",66,"I mean,",100,"it was",68,"literally done",67,"piece by",68,"piece.",34,"You had",67,"elements launch",68,"on either",67,"Russian proton",68,"rockets or",96,"carried up",56,"in the",56,"space shuttle",56,"where it",56,"would arrive,",56,"a big",56,"robotic arm",56,"would reach",56,"in and",56,"grab it",81,"out of",54,"the shuttle",53,"payload

tasks,",82,"and it",83,"was done",82,"piece by",82,"piece by",124,"people talking",84,"and working",82,"together all",83,"over the",84,"planet.",41,"And there's",83,"really not",83,"another engineering",228,"project or",74,"even big",75,"project like",74,"that that",74,"exists.",38,"I think",74,"it's, it",74,"has been",75,"described as",74,"one of",97,"the greatest",61,"engineering feats",59,"in human",61,"history.",30,"Not to",59,"two to",61,"our own",60,"horn, but",59,"we would",61,"certainly, I",115,"would certainly",86,"argue that",85,"building a",86,"football

I",51,"to say?",74,-1,0,"We're a little",66,"bit biased.",44,"We're a little",66,"biased.",22,"So, okay, let's",67,"kind of think",66,"about what it",66,"looks like, right,",96,"and how",52,"it operates.",52,"So, we",52,"talked about",52,"how you",53,"don't have",52,"access to,",52,"you can't",52,"just walk",74,"outside or you",68,"can't drill for",69,"more resources.",45,"Everything has to",68,"be there, so",69,"it's got to",68,"have power.",81,"It's got",58,"to have",59,"air.",29,"It's got",58,"to have",59,"waters.",29,"You have",58,"all these",59,"things.",29,"So, let's",58,"power.",70,-1,0,"Where's it",82,"get, it's",82,"mean power?",82,"This sun,",81,"everything comes",82,"from the",82,"sun.",41,"Now, it's,",82,"it's incredible.",108,-1,0,"And a",52,"lot of",52,"spacecraft do",53,"this because",52,"you have",52,"the sun.",53,"I mean,",52,"the sun",53,"is, we",52,"have solar",52,"energy here",86,"on earth,",61,"but in",59,"outer space,",61,"you can",60,"have even",59,"more direct",61,"access to",59,"the sun.",61,"It's very",87,"readily available",55,"energy source",55,"in space.",55,"It's readily",55,"available.",28,"That we",54,"know

on",75,"station is",76,"generated through",76,"solar energy.",75,"And we",76,"had talked",75,"about, they",76,"see 16",89,"sun rises",52,"in sunset",52,"today.",26,"So, about",52,"half the",51,"time, they're",52,"in complete",52,"darkness.",26,"So, there",52,"is no",52,"sun.",170,-1,0,"So, what you",73,"have is you",74,"have these great",73,"big solar arrays",74,"that are generating",73,"power, and",68,"then there's a",64,"bunch of batteries",65,"on board.",44,"And the solar",64,"arrays are just",65,"charging up those",65,"batteries every",73,"time they",52,"slip behind",51,"the earth",52,"again, and",51,"they're in",52,"night time.",51,"Those batteries",52,"are just",100,"flying power",98,"to everything.",98,"But it's",98,"100% solar",98,"renewable, clean,",97,"sun

that",58,"actually they",58,"do have",57,"to, like,",58,"kind of",57,"get rid",58,"of some",58,"of that",57,"power, because",58,"it's kind",66,"of, it's a",55,"little bit redundant,",56,"right?",18,"It just gives",56,"one of them",55,"breaks, like you",56,"still have",71,"enough power",52,"to power",53,"up everything.",52,"You do",53,"have redundancy",52,"built in.",53,"redundancy is",52,"one of",87,"our favorite",69,"words.",34,"redundancy is",69,"a fancy",69,"word for",69,"backup plan.",68,"Yeah.",35,"And at",68,"NASA, we",69,"have backup",69,"plans for",82,"your backup plan.",72,"So, yeah, even",72,"if you lose,",73,"we call them",72,"power channels.",48,"If you lose",72,"one, you",73,"lose two.",50,"You can still",74,"power the majority",74,"of

still",54,"power your",81,"key systems.",54,"Now, everything,",54,"you might",55,"just power",54,"down other",55,"things temporarily",54,"while you",102,"fix the",94,"problem.",47,-1,0,"But it,",94,"they generate",94,"pretty much",95,"a comparable",94,"amount to",94,"keep everything",94,"that we",124,"want on",58,"board nuts.",58,"That's all",59,"the life",58,"support that's",58,"keeping

the",67,"right attitude",68,"and flying",68,"in, in",69,"any time.",68,"I mean,",67,"everything, everything,",106,"everything, everything.",76,"It's power",76,"by the",76,"solar arrays.",75,"And it",76,"doesn't generate",76,"an overwhelming",104,"access of",55,"energy by",57,"any means.",56,"Because again,",56,"you are",56,"spending a",55,"lot of",57,"time in",56,"darkness.",58,-1,0,"So those",61,"batteries are",61,"getting used",62,"pretty much",61,"constantly.",30,"We're in",62,"the process",61,"of swapping",61,"the

all",83,"solar energy",83,"through those",116,"bigs.",32,"And they",64,"are very",64,"large.",32,"We come",64,"back to",64,"the football",64,"field, the",64,"American football",64,"field and",106,"now it's",74,"a big",74,"thing.",37,"We haven't",74,"clarified yet",74,"yet.",37,"Yeah.",37,"That the",74,"solar arrays",74,"are basically",107,"each solar",64,"array is",64,"the size",64,"of an",64,"end

of",81,"four.",41,"So it's",81,"tough because",82,"one pair",81,"is actually",118,"two array",74,"blankets.",37,"But they're",74,"very large.",74,"Yes.",37,"Yeah.",36,"Okay.",37,"So that's",74,"power.",37,"Right.",37,"So we",74,"already talked",87,"about water",51,"because you",51,"need to",50,"recycle water",51,"and make",51,"sure you",50,"have enough",51,"and water's",79,"very expensive",57,"to launch.",57,"And if",57,"you recycle",57,"it, it's",56,"a lot",57,"more efficient",57,"and it's",57,"very, very,",76,"very clean.",47,"So what about",71,"air?",23,"Right?",24,"That's one thing.",71,"You know, you",71,"think about like",71,"what a human",111,"needs shelter,",80,"water, food.",80,"You didn't",80,"really think",80,"about air",80,"because but",80,"that's something",80,"you definitely",91,"need to",51,"say.",26,"That's something",51,"we kind",52,"of take",51,"for granted.",51,"And air",52,"is just,",51,"it's air.",91,-1,0,"It's everywhere",79,"down here.",79,"You're in",79,"a sealed",80,"environment.",39,"You're basically",79,"in a",79,"big sealed",79,"tin can",115,"and you",71,"need to",71,"fill that",71,"with air.",70,"So we",71,"can

into",56,"the atmosphere.",112,"But the",85,"main way",85,"we get",85,"it is",85,"from water.",84,"We use",85,"a system",85,"called the",85,"oxygen generation",135,"system",50,"that",51,"actually",50,"takes",50,"water.",51,"Splits",50,"the",50,"atom,",51,"splits",50,"the",50,"atom,",51,"but",50,"splits",50,"it",51,"the",50,"water",83,"molecule into",65,"oxygen and",65,"hydrogen.",32,"And then",65,"we can",65,"take that",65,"oxygen and",64,"pump it",65,"into the",65,"atmosphere.",62,-1,0,"And they",60,"aren't in",60,"the pure",60,"oxygen atmosphere.",60,"So there's",59,"other stuff",60,"in there.",60,"There's a",60,"lot of",97,"nitrogen.",38,"So very",75,"similar to",75,"Earth's atmosphere.",75,"Yeah.",37,"They're basically",75,"in the",75,"exact same",75,"composition atmosphere",117,"that we",79,"have on",79,"Earth.",39,"And actually",79,"the same",80,"pressure too.",79,"So there's",79,"no big",79,"difference there.",89,"That

water",74,"molecules.",37,"So then",73,"you have",74,"your oxygen,",96,"which you can",66,"just feed directly",66,"back into the",66,"cabin.",22,"And then you",66,"have hydrogen, which",112,"you can",68,"vent overboard.",68,"If you",68,"just build",69,"up a",68,"bunch of",68,"excess hydrogen",68,"or there's",68,"a process",99,"and a",65,"payload up",65,"there.",33,"It's used.",65,"It's more",65,"of a",65,"technology demonstration.",65,-1,0,"So it's",92,"not really",56,"in the",55,"critical path.",56,"So it's",56,"not a",55,"critical piece",56,"that we",55,"have to",56,"have running",91,"at all",72,"times.",36,"But it's",71,"called the",72,"subodyye.",36,"It uses",71,"the subodyye",72,"process where",71,"you can",72,"take that",105,"hydrogen that",66,"you had",67,"left over",66,"from your",67,"water.",33,"And then",67,"you can",66,"take the",67,"carbon dioxide",66,"that gets",90,"scrubbed out",56,"of the",57,"atmosphere by",56,"a different",57,"device.",28,"You split",56,"that carbon",57,"dioxide.",28,"You now",56,"have oxygen",228,"and then you",70,"have your leftover",71,"hydrogen.",24,"You combine those",70,"two and you",71,"have more water.",111,-1,0,"And so",82,"you can",81,"kind of",82,"build the",81,"ideal is",82,"to build",81,"a closed",81,"loop.",41,"So everything",82,"that gets",81,"put into",120,"this life",77,"support loop.",77,"It's a",78,"big circle.",77,"Just constantly",77,"gets recycled.",77,"You got",77,"your water.",103,-1,0,"You drink",50,"your water.",51,"You recycle",50,"your water.",51,"You take",50,"some of",51,"that water.",50,"You turn",51,"it into",82,"air and",62,"oxygen.",31,"You take",62,"that excess",62,"hydrogen.",32,"You combine",62,"it with",62,"CO2.",31,"The astronauts",62,"are breathing",89,"out.",27,"You make",53,"more water.",53,"And so",53,"it's all",53,"just kind",53,"of constantly",53,"going around",53,"in a",53,"circle.",59,-1,0,"And that",65,"way you",65,"get the",64,"absolute most",65,"of everything",65,"you've sent",65,"up there.",65,"That's crazy.",65,"You actually",100,"have to",70,"create an",71,"atmosphere.",35,"It's not",70,"like Earth",71,"where it",70,"kind of",70,"does it",71,"for us.",70,"You actually",96,"have to",50,"make it",51,"work.",25,"That's crazy.",51,"I like",50,"the subodyye",51,"system.",25,"That's clearly",50,"says it's",51,"a technology",72,"demonstration.",22,"I thought it",64,"was like part",65,"of a whole",65,"thing because I",65,"know they call",65,"it a partially",96,"closely because",63,"like you",63,"said you",63,"can eject",64,"the hydrogen",63,"if you",63,"have too",63,"much.",31,"But it's",97,"kind of",66,"the same",67,"concept.",33,"So they",66,"have air,",67,"they have",66,"water, they",66,"have power,",67,"they have",66,"all kinds",101,"of stuff.",70,"So let's",70,"talk about",69,"some of",70,"the experiments.",69,"I know",70,"one of",70,"the biggest",69,"one is",70,"the experiment",132,"on themselves.",97,"In order",97,"to actually",97,"function beyond",97,"lower th",97,"orbit and",97,"actually function",124,"in space,",54,"you have",54,"to learn",54,"how the",54,"human body",54,"reacts in",54,"space and",54,"what happens.",54,-1,0,"So I",54,"think the",84,"biggest thing,",59,"maybe it's",59,"not the",59,"biggest thing.",59,"But it's",59,"definitely a",59,"very important",59,"is bone",198,"loss and",72,"muscle degradation.",72,"So that",72,"is if",72,"you're in",72,"space for",72,"too long",72,"and you're",72,"just kind",115,"of floating",86,"around, your",87,"bones start",87,"to exhibit",86,"symptoms of",87,"osteoporosis and",86,"your muscle",87,"start to",124,"grade.",37,"So how",74,"do they",74,"counter that?",74,"Yeah.",37,"Well when",74,"we talk",74,"research, there's",74,"really, there's",74,"kind of",119,"two different",88,"camps.",44,"There's the",89,"research that",88,"we're doing",89,"on

you're",83,"just talking",55,"about.",28,"And then",55,"there's the",55,"research that",55,"has direct",55,"applications on",55,"Earth and",55,"we can",105,"dive into",98,"that too,",98,"but that's",98,"research flown",97,"by commercial",98,"companies by",98,"academia, taking",98,"advantage of",114,"this microgravity",63,"environment because",65,"we've seen",63,"there's a",65,"lot you",64,"can learn",64,"by taking",64,"gravity out",105,"of the",73,"equation.",37,-1,0,"But to",73,"the first",73,"camp, to",73,"the, you",74,"know, studying",73,"the people,",73,"the astronauts",117,"or guinea",86,"pigs kind",86,"of thing,",86,"the human",87,"body is",86,"an incredible",86,"machine and",86,"it's incredible",86,"at adapting",133,"to different",89,"environments.",44,"I mean,",89,"that's, that's",89,"both a",89,"gifted occurs",89,"because when",89,"you go",114,"into outer",69,"space, I",69,"mean, you're",70,"your vestibular",69,"system, so",70,"you're sensitive,",69,"you know,",69,"up is",91,"down, down, it's",66,"up, your balance,",65,"all of that",66,"goes all out",65,"of whack, but",66,"within about a",65,"day or two,",98,"most astronauts",66,"don't have",66,"the nausea",66,"anymore, their",66,"body is",65,"used to",66,"it already",66,"and they're",66,"able to",100,"live and",67,"work, which",68,"that's incredible.",67,"That's a",67,"great advantage",68,"to just",67,"getting into",67,"a new",68,"environment and",90,"hitting the",56,"ground running.",56,-1,0,"The problem",56,"with that",56,"is when",56,"you get",56,"to an",56,"environment where",89,"you have",67,"gravity again,",67,"hitting the",67,"ground running",67,"can be",67,"very problematic",67,"because your",67,"body when",94,"it's not,",60,"when gravity",60,"is not",60,"pulling down",60,"on you.",61,"So you",60,"and I",60,"right now,",60,"you mean",60,"gravity is",81,"pushing down",51,"on you",51,"at all",51,"times and",51,"that builds",51,"up muscles",51,"in your",51,"hips and",51,"bones in",51,"your hips",83,"and that's",66,"why your",66,"legs are",66,"strong enough",66,"to just",66,"hold you",66,"upright because",66,"they're constantly",107,"fighting against",84,"that force.",84,"On places",84,"like the",83,"space station,",84,"that force",84,"disappears and",84,"so your",114,"body says,",60,"well, I",61,"don't need",61,"these muscles",60,"anymore, so",61,"it stops",61,"feeding nutrients",60,"to those",61,"and so",106,"you can",90,"actually astronauts",90,"will dispel,",91,"so in",90,"their urine",90,"they'll get",91,"raised levels",90,"of calcium,",121,"because their",60,"bones aren't",60,"needing it",60,"as much",60,"because their",60,"bones aren't",59,"getting that",61,"much force",88,"just by",59,"existing.",29,-1,0,"They're getting",59,"rid of",58,"the calcium",59,"because the",59,"body says,",59,"you don't",58,"need this",99,"anymore.",35,"And so",69,"understanding a",69,"lot of",70,"those processes",69,"is important",69,"because I",70,"mean if",69,"the astronauts",86,"were just",52,"going to",51,"stay in",52,"microgravity forever,",51,"not that",52,"big of",51,"a deal",52,"because they're",88,"body just",72,"adapts and",73,"they mean",72,"they become",73,"space people,",72,"but astronauts",73,"come back",72,"to Earth,",98,"astronauts will",52,"walk on",52,"Mars where",52,"there is",51,"gravity, less",52,"gravity, but",52,"still gravity",52,"and you're",79,"going to",55,"need to",55,"walk around",55,"in a",54,"pretty heavy",55,"space suit",55,"and things",55,"like that.",55,"So finding",55,"ways to",168,"counteract, countermeasures,",82,"for all",82,"the ways",82,"the body",82,"adapts is",82,"it's something",82,"that we've",82,"been doing",117,"pretty much",76,"as long",77,"as we've",76,"been doing",77,"space flight,",76,"but we've",77,"really aggressively",76,"pursued it",117,"onboard the",80,"space station.",80,-1,0,"So for",80,"example, bone",80,"loss and",80,"muscle loss,",80,"we've actually",80,"pretty much",112,"reversed for",65,"the most",65,"part, all",64,"of the",65,"bone loss",65,"and muscle",65,"loss.",32,"You'll see",65,"changes in",65,"bone density",92,"in some",59,"of the",59,"crew members,",59,"but a",60,"lot of",59,"them aren't",59,"losing that",59,"bone mass,",59,"that muscle",94,"mass that",68,"was such",68,"a problem",68,"in early",68,"long duration",69,"space flight.",68,"And we",68,"do that",68,"to exercise.",104,-1,0,"That is,",73,"that is",72,"the main",72,"driver.",36,"There's exercise",71,"and there's",73,"nutrition, but",72,"exercise, the",100,"crew members",55,"are working",56,"out about",57,"two hours",56,"every single",55,"day.",28,"I don't",56,"know about",57,"you, but",56,"I don't",80,"work out two",75,"hours every single",74,"day.",25,"30 minutes, I'm",74,"pretty much telling",75,"you.",25,"Yeah.",24,"Even that can",75,"be hard",80,"for some",56,"people to",55,"find, but",56,"the crew",55,"members, two",56,"hours every",56,"single day.",55,"And that's",56,"exercise both",123,"cardio and",95,"resistance.",47,"So they",95,"have a",96,"number of",95,"devices up",95,"there.",47,"They have",95,"a treadmill,",124,"which again,",56,"you need",56,"to remember",56,"everything and",56,"this is",56,"the running",56,"theme.",28,"Everything we",56,"do in",87,"microgravity is",62,"different.",31,"So you",62,"can't just",62,"hop on",63,"a treadmill.",62,"You'll just",62,"float away.",62,"And you'll",88,"just be",52,"pumping your",51,"legs and",52,"microgravity and",52,"that does",51,"nothing for",52,"you.",25,"So the",52,"treadmill actually",92,"has a",81,"harness with",81,"basically bungee",81,"cables that",81,"pulls them",81,"down towards",81,"the treadmill.",110,-1,0,"So that",57,"way you're",58,"getting the",57,"force and",57,"your legs,",57,"you're actually",58,"exerting more",57,"force and",57,"you can",82,"run.",24,"It's closer you",72,"can get to",72,"just running in",71,"space.",24,"And I mean",73,"we've had astronauts",72,"run marathons",87,"on the",65,"treadmill and",64,"that's one",64,"of their",63,"cute devices.",64,"They also",65,"have something",157,"called the",58,"advanced resistive",58,"exercise

call",51,"it a",51,"red.",25,"And it",51,"is, it's",76,"there.",25,"It's basically",51,"their home",50,"gym on",50,"board the",51,"station.",25,"Now again,",50,"you can't",51,"just pick",50,"up a",72,"heavyweight and do",63,"some curls and",64,"you know, get",63,"a workout.",43,"Wait, that's a",64,"work.",21,"It makes no",63,"sense.",50,-1,0,"It's a",58,"grand-go-gravity.",29,"Yeah.",29,"There's microgravity.",57,"So I",58,"mean they",57,"can they",58,"literally move",94,"several hundred",72,"pound modules",73,"and pieces",72,"of hardware",73,"all the",72,"time.",36,"And so",73,"to help",72,"simulate weightlifting,",120,"it actually",84,"uses a",84,"series of",84,"pneumatic tubes",83,"to simulate",84,"force.",42,"And they",84,"can actually",119,"simulate up",70,"to 600",70,"pounds of",70,"force.",35,"Nice.",35,"Which?",35,"Some of",69,"the astronauts.",71,"They're squat.",94,-1,0,"Their squat number",74,"goes up when",73,"they're up there.",74,"And it's slightly",73,"misleading because they're",99,"not squatting",51,"their own",50,"body weight",51,"like they",51,"are here",50,"on earth.",51,"Right.",25,"It's still",51,"600 pounds.",81,-1,0,"I don't",60,"think I",60,"can't do",60,"600 pounds.",60,"But they",61,"have the",60,"option if",60,"we ever",60,"get some",60,"power lifters",87,"one day.",53,"Up on",53,"board the",53,"station.",27,"And then",53,"they also",53,"have a",53,"stationary bicycle.",53,"And then",53,"there's another",77,"treadmill.",25,"So there's",50,"actually, well",51,"there's two",50,"treadmills on",50,"board the",50,"station.",59,-1,0,"But I",66,"mean they",67,"use all",66,"of those",67,"two hours",66,"a day",67,"just and",66,"that's just",67,"a main",110,"pain that",88,"bone and",87,"muscle.",44,"And there's",88,"also ways",87,"you can",88,"help that",87,"process through",88,"nutrition.",69,-1,0,"We're constantly",52,"looking, is",52,"there a",52,"better way",51,"for them",52,"to work",52,"out?",26,"Should they",52,"do?",57,-1,0,"I mean",63,"there's something",63,"there are",63,"research projects",63,"like Sprint",63,"where it",63,"does it",63,"make sense",96,"for them",64,"to work",64,"out a",64,"lot harder",64,"but for",64,"shorter amount",64,"of time.",64,"Like high",64,"intensity.",64,-1,0,"Yeah.",32,"Yeah.",32,"Because two",64,"hours is",64,"a long",64,"time every",64,"single day.",64,"Right.",32,"That's a",64,"lot to",64,"ask.",57,-1,0,"And so.",52,"And crew",51,"time is",51,"very valuable,",52,"right?",25,"Because they,",52,"I mean",51,"you're talking",51,"about like",52,"you said",113,"200, I",88,"think it's",87,"200 experiments",88,"per increment,",87,"right?",44,"And astronaut",87,"250 is",88,"the usual",117,"is the",60,"usual number.",60,"And like",60,"her six",60,"months span.",59,"250 experiments",60,"will happen",60,"on board",60,"the station.",94,-1,0,"That's crazy.",68,"So yeah,",68,"crew time",68,"is very",68,"valuable and",69,"that's two",68,"hours gone",68,"every day",68,"from experiment",108,"time just",78,"to maintain",79,"but moped",78,"bone and",78,"muscle mass.",79,"Yeah.",39,"Wow.",39,"But I",79,"mean that's",78,"just one",78,"part of",112,"what changes",72,"when you're",72,"in microgravity.",72,"I mean",71,"there, you",72,"your body",73,"actually has",72,"less blood",72,"in it.",98,-1,0,"By the",52,"time you",53,"come home,",53,"your heart",52,"can change",53,"sizes because",52,"it doesn't",53,"work as",52,"hard to",53,"pump

that's",96,"something that",96,"we knew",97,"about.",48,"But it",96,"was never",96,"really considered",96,"a huge",96,"deal, not",96,"a huge",133,"deal.",37,"But never",74,"really considered",74,"a major",74,"impact until",74,"within the",74,"last couple",74,"of years",74,"when we",74,"had a",115,"significant amount",77,"of astronauts",77,"returning from",77,"these really",77,"long stays",77,"in

happening?",230,-1,0,"So you",65,"gotta find",65,"those countermeasures",65,"doing that",66,"happen.",32,"Wow.",33,"That's really",65,"intense.",59,-1,0,"I mean",53,"imagine getting",53,"like

on",98,"the international",66,"space station",67,"pretty regularly,",66,"they're doing",67,"long duration",66,"increments, right?",86,"So they're",52,"doing six",52,"months at",52,"a time.",52,"Yes.",26,"So this",52,"is longer",52,"than any",52,"of the",51,"shuttle missions,",99,"a lot",72,"of the",73,"missions before",72,"it.",37,"And it's",72,"all to",73,"practice for",72,"missions beyond",105,"lower the",64,"orbit.",32,"But when",64,"they come",63,"back to",64,"Earth, right?",65,"They generally",64,"right now",63,"they come",64,"back in",87,"a
