scientists,",77,"engineers, astronauts,",78,"pretty much all",66,"the folks that",67,"have the coolest",67,"information, the stuff",67,"you really want",66,"to know",53,"right on",60,"the show",60,"and tell",61,"you more",60,"about all",60,"things NASA.",61,"We're talking",66,"everything from",66,"extraterrestrial dirt",67,"to the",66,"unknown parts",67,"of the",66,"universe.",34,"So today",57,"on the",57,"first episode",57,"ever, we're",57,"talking International",57,"Space Station",57,"with Dan",58,"Hewitt.",100,"He's the",51,"public affairs",52,"officer for",51,"the Space",52,"Station program",51,"here at",52,"the NASA",51,"Johnson Space",52,"Center in",88,"Houston, Texas.",88,"And we",51,"had a",52,"great discussion",51,"about what",52,"the

right",63,"ahead to our",63,"talk with Mr.",64,"Dan",50,"Hewitt.",50,"Enjoy.",100,"T-minus",140,"five",140,"seconds",140,"in",140,"counting.",140,"Mark.",100,"Launching",116,"mid-flight",117,"search",117,"for",116,"the",117,"red.",117,"Here she",66,"goes.",34,"Houston, we have",60,"a podcast.",40,"It's",50,"true.",50,"Very",50,"true.",50,"So anyway,",50,"let's begin.",50,"I figured you're the perfect person to have",53,"here being the public affairs officer for the",72,"Space Station",50,"program.",25,"You",115,"talk",115,"to",116,"scientists,",115,"astronauts,",115,"engineers",116,"constantly,",115,"so",116,"you're",115,"very",115,"aware",116,"of",115,"what's",116,"going on",63,"and everything",63,"about the",63,"Space Station.",63,-1,0,"So for",51,"those of",51,"you listening,",51,"I think",52,"this is",51,"a good",51,"opportunity to",52,"learn just",51,"everything about",59,"it, right?",67,"So start",69,"from the",69,"very beginning.",70,"What is",66,"it?",34,"Everything.",100,"Awesome.",100,"So let's",80,"start in",80,"the beginning.",80,"So the",66,"Space Station",66,"is a",66,"giant spaceship.",66,"I mean,",86,"it is",87,"the largest",87,"spacecraft that",86,"humans have",87,"ever built.",87,"And we",69,"haven't been",70,"flying in",70,"space for",70,"too long,",70,"relatively.",35,"I mean,",50,"we've been",51,"up there",50,"for 50",51,"or 60",50,"years.",26,"But the Space",73,"Station is kind",73,"of the pinnacle",73,"for what we've",73,"built so far.",74,"It is",66,"massive.",34,"I mean,",92,"this thing",93,"supports multiple",92,"people.",47,"It's been",64,"up there,",64,"at least",65,"pieces of",64,"it, since",64,"1998.",33,"So that's",66,"another one",66,"of those",67,"factoid alerts",66,"that we",67,"always like",66,"to tell",66,"people.",34,"If you",62,"were born",63,"after the",62,"year 1998,",62,"the spacecraft's",63,"always been",62,"up there,",63,"but if",62,"you were",73,"born after",72,"the year,",72,"after November",72,"of 2000,",73,"as long",72,"as you've",72,"been alive,",72,"human beings",76,"have been",80,"living and",79,"working in",80,"space.",40,-1,0,"We are",77,"aliens.",39,"We",50,"are",50,"a",50,"space-faring",50,"species.",50,"We are",57,"the ones",58,"off the",58,"planet.",28,"We've had",61,"people up",61,"there every",60,"single day",61,"for, as",60,"of right",61,"now, over",60,"16 years.",61,"I mean,",86,"that is",86,"mind-blowing.",43,"And they're",63,"doing stuff",63,"every single",62,"day that's",63,"either going",62,"to impact",63,"us here",63,"on Earth",62,"or get",52,"us ready to",62,"go further out.",62,"I mean,",52,"that is",52,"the purpose",53,"of the",52,"Space Station.",53,"That's why",60,"it's up",60,"there.",30,"That's why",72,"we have",73,"this huge",73,"thing floating",73,"above us.",73,"So you",62,"say stuff.",62,"We're doing",54,"stuff every",54,"day.",28,"Obviously, living",54,"up there,",55,"I think,",55,"is a",55,"big part",54,"of it,",55,"right?",28,"Like you",64,"said, we're",64,"explorers, we're",64,"spacefarers.",32,"What is",54,"the stuff",54,"that's actually,",54,"you know,",54,"that has",54,"that impact?",54,"It's a lot",60,"of stuff.",40,"It's a lot",60,"of stuff.",40,"And I",59,"mean, it",60,"is, and",59,"it's divided",60,"up.",30,"It is",70,"as simple",70,"as just",70,"living in",70,"space.",36,-1,0,"So just everything",66,"you do in",66,"space is a",66,"little bit different",67,"than the way",66,"you do it",66,"down here",56,"on Earth.",67,"I mean, it",60,"could be anything",61,"from going to",60,"the bathroom to",61,"how you eat",61,"to just how",60,"you get",65,"your water.",88,"Everything's",69,"different.",69,"So it's",63,"like a",63,"way to",62,"practice, really,",64,"for things",63,"further out.",63,"Because it's not",68,"really far up,",69,"right?",23,"It's only",50,"250 miles.",50,"If you think",68,"about it, we're",69,"still in the",69,"Earth's protection.",46,"Oh,",50,"yeah.",50,"We're still",56,"protected by",56,"the Earth's",56,"magnetic field.",56,"Well, space",74,"is funny",75,"in that",74,"going up,",75,"it feels",74,"like it's",75,"so far",74,"away, space.",75,"But it's",78,"250 miles.",78,"That's not",88,"that far.",88,"I mean,",57,"I feel",57,"like the",58,"city of",57,"Houston is",57,"250 miles.",58,"It's",50,"not.",50,"But I",68,"mean, 250",68,"miles in",68,"a car",69,"is a",68,"short road",68,"trip.",35,"But 250",67,"miles straight",68,"up, that's",67,"a rocket",68,"ride.",34,-1,0,"That's a",65,"slightly different",65,"road trip.",66,"But it",60,"isn't that",60,"far away.",60,"I mean,",82,"we still",83,"kind of",83,"are right",83,"on the",83,"doorstep.",42,"There's",62,"a",62,"really",63,"great",62,"quote",63,"in",62,"the",62,"Paramount",63,"of",62,"Space",62,"movies,",63,"Armageddon,",62,"where",63,"Owen",62,"Wilson",62,"says, you",56,"know, we're",55,"not even",55,"in outer",55,"space yet.",56,"This is",56,"just like",55,"the beginning.",56,"And that's",52,"kind of",53,"where the",52,"station is.",52,"It's in",66,"space.",34,"It's in what",58,"we call low",59,"Earth orbit.",39,"So it's",59,"still pretty",59,"close.",29,"I mean,",53,"they could",53,"get in",52,"a Soyuz",53,"spacecraft and",53,"be back",52,"on the",53,"ground inside",53,"of it",52,"for a",51,"couple of",50,"hours.",25,"So, I",53,"mean, you're",52,"still right",53,"on the",52,"doorstep.",27,"You're not",59,"really way",59,"out there",60,"yet.",30,"But it's",52,"getting us",52,"ready to",52,"go way",52,"out there.",52,"Well, that's",73,"the whole,",73,"so NASA",74,"describes it",73,"as Earth-reliant,",74,"right?",37,-1,0,"So I kind",64,"of like the",64,"way they section",64,"it off, right?",64,"Earth-reliant means",53,"exactly what",54,"you said,",54,"right?",27,"So if",57,"something goes",57,"wrong, you",58,"can just",57,"hop in",57,"a spacecraft",58,"and be",57,"home in",57,"three hours.",58,"And it's",56,"easy to",56,"get stuff",56,"there because",56,"it's only,",56,"I mean,",56,"some Soyuz",56,"rides have",56,"been as",56,"little as",65,"like six",65,"hours, right?",66,"Relatively",50,"easy.",50,"So just going to",50,"space is, yeah, let's-",50,"It's only",50,"rocket science.",50,"Don't want to",60,"trivialize it.",40,"It's still,",69,"and even,",69,"you're going",69,"to have",69,"to admonish",69,"myself.",35,"It's still",50,"not easy",50,"to go",50,"to space.",50,"It's still, I",63,"mean, it is",63,"rocket science.",42,"It's literal",77,"rocket science,",77,"which is",78,"hugely complex",77,"and there's",78,"always inherent",77,"risk and",78,"all these",75,"other things.",75,"But when",69,"you start",70,"comparing it",69,"to, you",70,"know, going",70,"to Mars",69,"or, you",70,"know, our",70,"far-flung aspirations",80,"of spreading",90,"throughout the",91,"solar system",90,"and the",91,"galaxy and",90,"everything, when",91,"you compare",78,"it to",79,"that, it's,",78,"you know,",79,"doing hand",78,"quotes easy,",79,"but it's",79,"still a",78,"monumental undertaking.",140,-1,0,"Yeah.",100,"And that's why,",68,"so we're doing",69,"that, just like",69,"you said, in",68,"the future we",69,"want to go",69,"farther,",50,"right?",50,"So we want to",57,"go to Mars.",43,"We want",50,"to really",50,"just expand",50,"our presence",50,"in the",50,"solar system.",50,"So the",79,"International Space",79,"Station is",80,"a great",79,"way to",79,"practice that.",80,"It's a good,",72,"like you have",72,"a good understanding",72,"of what it",72,"takes to live",72,"in space, to",72,"operate in",74,"space.",50,"You can do",73,"a ton of",73,"science and learn",73,"how things interact.",73,"And then",52,"if you",53,"learn how",52,"things interact,",52,"you can",53,"design better",53,"systems to",52,"make them",53,"work",50,"better.",50,"I think",55,"one of",56,"the ones,",55,"I think",56,"capillary action,",55,"I think",56,"was a",55,"great one.",56,"Like the",60,"way that",60,"fluids move",60,"in space",60,"is kind",60,"of cool",60,"because they",60,"sort of",60,"like create",60,"a ball",62,"and there's",63,"no down.",63,"So if",66,"you're trying",67,"to design",67,"like a",66,"system that,",67,"like a",67,"rocket system",66,"in order",67,"to propel",67,"fuel, you",60,"need to,",61,"the fuel",61,"isn't going",60,"to go",61,"down, right?",61,-1,0,"Something kind of",72,"needs to have",73,"that sort of",73,"capillary action and",72,"a path to",73,"get there.",49,"It's like",53,"little, those",54,"little tiny",54,"things are",54,"things that",54,"make the",54,"huge difference",54,"in being able",62,"to kind of",53,"explore the solar",54,"system.",18,"Well, it",71,"all comes",71,"to down",72,"to gravity",71,"and that's",72,"kind of",71,"the ultimate",72,"differentiator between",62,"why everything",54,"we do",54,"in outer",54,"space is",54,"different from",53,"the way",54,"we do",54,"it on",54,"Earth.",27,"Some of",76,"the stuff",77,"you touch",77,"on is",77,"very apt.",77,"I mean,",71,"just moving",72,"fluids where,",71,"you know,",72,"here on",71,"Earth, we",72,"almost take",71,"it for",72,"granted that",65,"everything settles",59,"towards the",58,"bottom.",30,"So in",53,"plumbing systems",54,"and everything,",53,"you can",54,"use that",53,"to your",54,"advantage.",27,"In space,",52,"you don't",52,"have that.",52,"And that",63,"affects everything",63,"from moving",63,"rocket fuel",63,"to, you",63,"know, I'm",63,"an astronaut",63,"and I",63,"need to",51,"get a",51,"drink of",52,"water.",26,"Well, that",84,"system has",85,"to be",85,"specifically designed",85,"to work",85,"in the",84,"absence of",85,"gravity.",43,-1,0,"And we've",58,"had a",58,"lot of",59,"practice, you",58,"know, since",58,"we've been",59,"flying in",58,"space since",58,"the '60s.",146,"But the",89,"station is",90,"really the",90,"first place",90,"you've had",90,"on this",90,"scale.",45,"There have",60,"been space",60,"stations in",60,"the past,",60,"both from",60,"the U.S.",60,"and Russia.",60,"But the",98,"space station",99,"is really",99,"the modern",99,"cutting edge",99,"test bed",98,"for just",99,"doing and",99,"learning everything",114,"about",65,"living",65,"in",65,"space.",65,"And so",64,"you have",64,"all of",64,"these different",64,"technologies that,",64,"like I",64,"said earlier,",64,"everything you",64,"do in",56,"space is",56,"different from",56,"the way",56,"that you",57,"do it",56,"on planet",56,"Earth, where,",56,"you know,",57,"you",63,"have",64,"oxygen",64,"thanks",63,"to",64,"natural",64,"cycles.",64,"And you",71,"have trees",71,"scrubbing carbon",72,"dioxide from",71,"your atmosphere",71,"and producing",72,"oxygen back",74,"for you.",76,-1,0,"You have",79,"water and",79,"lakes, reservoirs",79,"coming, literally",79,"raining down",80,"on you",79,"from the",79,"sky, where",85,"in space,",90,"none of",90,"that exists.",91,"You have to",64,"create it.",44,"You either",51,"have to",52,"bring it",52,"with you",51,"or find",52,"a way",52,"to create",52,"it.",26,"And that's something",67,"that we're doing",67,"on the station",67,"right now, where",67,"you're trying to",68,"-- and",64,"that's one",66,"of those",65,"key --",65,"we always",65,"talk about",65,"the different",65,"technologies that",65,"you",50,"need.",50,"And technology",70,"is a",71,"really broad",71,"term.",36,"But one",79,"of the",79,"ones that",79,"is a",79,"lot probably",79,"easier to",79,"understand is",80,"how we",79,"get those",79,"things, how",70,"you get",62,"the water,",61,"how you",61,"get the",62,"air, just",61,"for the",61,"crew members.",62,"And one",60,"of the",61,"things you've",61,"got to",61,"remember is,",61,"again, so",61,"we're close",61,"to Earth",61,"right now,",60,"so we",51,"can launch",50,"water, we",50,"can launch",50,"air, we",51,"can launch",50,"all these",50,"things to",50,"these crew",51,"members.",138,-1,0,"But when",66,"they go",66,"to Mars,",66,"there's no",66,"resupply ship.",66,"There's no,",72,"you know,",73,"\"Hey, the",73,"water tank's",73,"getting low.",73,"Let's stop",60,"off here",60,"and tap",59,"it off.\"",60,"You can't",83,"do that.",81,"So you've",74,"got to",75,"bring everything",74,"with you.",74,"And",64,"everything",64,"is",65,"heavy.",65,"So the more",57,"stuff you bring",58,"with you, the",57,"more fuel you",58,"need, the more",57,"expensive your mission,",61,"and it just",67,"kind of compounds",67,"on and on",66,"and on and",67,"on.",23,"And I'm going",66,"to ramble here",65,"for a while,",66,"because I love",67,"this subject.",43,"Okay.",100,"Well, I'll kind of",60,"-- I'm not going",60,"to stop you.",45,"I'm going",53,"to kind",53,"of like",53,"re-divert you.",53,"So one",61,"of the",61,"things on",61,"the International",61,"Space Station",61,"they're doing",61,"now to",61,"do exactly",61,"that, so",53,"you said",53,"things are",53,"heavy, right?",53,"Water.",100,"Water especially",51,"is very",51,"heavy.",26,"Yes.",100,"I forget",50,"the cost",50,"per pound",50,"in order",50,"to launch",50,"water.",26,"It always",66,"varies.",34,-1,0,"It always",66,"varies.",34,"I don't",66,"know.",34,"But I",55,"know the",56,"-- like,",55,"one way",56,"they're actually",55,"doing --",56,"like, helping",55,"that out",56,"for long-duration",56,"missions",64,"is",64,"recycling.",64,"And the",66,"recycling system",66,"is just",66,"top-notch.",34,"So good that",72,"they actually brought",73,"the technology back",73,"down to Earth",72,"and then actually",73,"is helping out",85,"third-world countries",72,"with, you",72,"know, not",72,"access to",72,"any kind",72,"of clean",72,"drinking water.",72,"It's like",57,"the filtration",57,"system is",56,"that good.",58,"They drink",58,"their own",59,"urine and",59,"it captures",59,"sweat and",59,"stuff like",59,"that, right?",59,"They",50,"do.",50,"And that's",62,"always a",62,"fun \"ew\"",62,"moment for",62,"little kids",62,"and stuff",62,"when you",62,"tell them",62,"that.",31,"And there's",84,"the famous",84,"astronaut saying",84,"that yesterday's",83,"coffee is",84,"tomorrow's coffee,",84,"to where",65,"that's what you",72,"have to do",71,"when you have",71,"these weight limits",71,"and you're in",72,"this environment",63,"where, you",79,"know, outside",79,"your four",79,"metal walls",79,"is just",79,"a vacuum",79,"of

really,",59,"when you think",59,"about global participation",60,"is the",99,"way that",99,"the modules",99,"are designed.",99,"So each",72,"of them",73,"were just",72,"given specifications,",73,"this is",72,"how it",73,"needs to",72,"be built.",73,"And they built",67,"them all over",67,"the world, and",67,"then launched them",67,"up into space",67,"and connected them",70,"for the",50,"first

again,",69,"that comes",70,"back to,",70,"you have",70,"these countries",70,"with language",70,"barriers, and",70,"just completely",77,"different ways",86,"of engineering",86,"and everything.",86,"But we",72,"built the",71,"station piece",73,"by piece",72,"in outer",72,"space.",35,"Like you just",59,"said, none of",59,"these things were",58,"connected on the",59,"ground the first",58,"time.",20,"So you",50,"better make",51,"sure that",50,"when you",51,"set it",50,"up to",51,"space, it's",50,"going to,",51,"like, you",50,"didn't build",56,"a square",61,"peg for",61,"a round",61,"hole kind",61,"of thing.",62,"So we",64,"had, there",64,"are definitely",64,"ways to",64,"share that",63,"knowledge, to",65,"share the",64,"technology, to",64,"make sure",93,"that all",93,"of your,",93,"you know,",93,"you can",93,"agree on",92,"standards, essentially,",94,"to make",93,"sure everything",51,"talks to",51,"each other,",52,"all the",51,"different electronics,",52,"or all",51,"the

like,",64,"right, and how",63,"it operates.",43,"So we",56,"talked about",56,"how you",57,"don't have",56,"access to,",57,"you can't",56,"just walk",57,"outside or",56,"you can't",57,"drill for",70,"more resources.",70,"Everything has to",56,"be there, so",57,"it's got to",57,"have power, it's",56,"got to have",57,"air, it's got",57,"to have water,",67,"it's got to",67,"have all

it's",66,"incredible, and",67,"a lot",66,"of spacecraft",66,"do this",67,"because you,",67,"you have",66,"the sun.",67,-1,0,"I mean,",61,"the sun",61,"is, we",62,"have solar",61,"energy here",62,"on

on",86,"station is",86,"generated through",85,"solar energy.",87,"And we",62,"had talked",62,"about, they",62,"see 16",62,"sunrises and",63,"sunsets a",62,"day, so",62,"about half",62,"the time",63,"they're in",74,"complete darkness.",74,"So there",81,"is no",82,"sun.",40,"So what",51,"you have",50,"is you",51,"have these",50,"great big",50,"solar arrays",51,"that are",50,"generating power,",50,"and then",52,"there's a",53,"bunch of",53,"batteries on",53,"board.",27,"And the solar",61,"arrays are just",62,"charging up those",61,"batteries so every",62,"time they slip",61,"behind

think",59,"it's, they",61,"actually, they're",60,"so big",59,"and they",61,"produce so",59,"much power",61,"that actually",60,"they do",50,"have to",51,"like kind",51,"of get",51,"rid of",51,"some of",51,"that power,",51,"because it's",51,"kind of,",51,"it's a little",66,"bit redundant, right?",60,"Just in case",60,"one of them",60,"breaks, like you",60,"still have enough",60,"power to

lose",72,"one, you lose",72,"two, you can",71,"still power the",72,"majority of all",72,"of your systems",72,"on",53,"board.",54,"And even",55,"going beyond",56,"that, if",56,"you lose,",56,"you know,",55,"a much",56,"larger amount",56,"of power,",56,"you can",56,"still power",58,"your key",58,"systems and",58,"everything.",30,-1,0,"You might",69,"just power",70,"down other",69,"things temporarily",70,"while you",69,"fix the",70,"problem.",35,"But they",94,"generate pretty",94,"much a",95,"comparable amount",94,"to keep",95,"everything that",94,"we want",94,"on board.",148,"So that's",53,"all the",54,"life support,",54,"that's keeping",53,"the lights",54,"on, that's",54,"running all",54,"of the",60,"experiments on",61,"board, all",60,"of the",61,"different

everything,",80,"everything, everything",80,"is powered",81,"by the",80,"solar arrays.",79,"And I",69,"mean, it",69,"doesn't generate",69,"an overwhelming",68,"excess of",69,"energy by",69,"any

is",73,"very expensive to",74,"launch.",25,"And if",63,"you recycle",64,"it, it's",64,"a lot",63,"more efficient",64,"and it's",64,"very, very",64,"clean.",32,"So what",74,"about

composition",53,"atmosphere that",54,"we have",54,"on Earth.",54,"And actually",98,"the same",99,"pressure too.",99,"So",66,"there's",67,"no",67,"big",66,"difference",67,"there.",67,"That feeds into",56,"some of the",56,"stuff they have",56,"to do for",56,"spacewalks, but that's",56,"a completely different",96,"tangent",58,"I",59,"can",58,"go",58,"on.",59,-1,0,"So we",78,"split the",79,"water molecules.",79,"So then you",69,"have your oxygen,",69,"which you can",69,"just feed directly",69,"back into the",69,"cabin.",23,"And then",59,"you have",59,"hydrogen, which",59,"you can",60,"vent overboard",59,"if you",59,"just build",60,"up a",59,"bunch of",78,"excess hydrogen,",98,"or there's",97,"a process",97,"in a",98,"payload up",97,"there.",49,"It's used,",58,"it's more",58,"of a",58,"technology demonstration.",58,"So it's",78,"not really",79,"in the",78,"critical path.",79,"So it's not",71,"a critical piece",72,"that we have",72,"to have running",71,"at all times,",72,"but it's called",72,"the",50,"sabatier.",50,"It uses",66,"the sabatier",66,"process where",66,"you can",66,"take that",66,"hydrogen that",66,"you had",66,"left over",66,"from your",67,"water, and",67,"then you",67,"can take",68,"the carbon",67,"dioxide that",67,"gets scrubbed",68,"out of",67,"the atmosphere",82,"by a",96,"different device.",96,"You split",74,"that carbon",75,"dioxide, you",74,"now have",75,"oxygen, and",74,"then you",75,"have your",74,"leftover hydrogen.",75,-1,0,"You combine",55,"those two,",55,"and you",55,"got more",55,"water.",28,"And so",64,"you can",65,"kind of",65,"build, the",65,"ideal is",65,"to build,",65,"we call",65,"it a",65,"closed loop.",65,"So everything",83,"that gets",83,"put into",83,"this life",83,"support loop,",83,"it's a",83,"big circle,",83,"just constantly",83,"gets",58,"recycled.",58,"You got",59,"your water,",60,"you drink",60,"your water,",60,"you recycle",59,"your water,",60,"you take",60,"some of",60,"that water,",60,"you turn",61,"it into",61,"air and",61,"oxygen, you",61,"take that",61,"excess hydrogen,",61,"you combine",61,"it with",59,"CO2 that",58,"the astronauts",58,"are breathing",57,"out, you",58,"make more",58,"water.",29,"And so",53,"it's all",54,"just kind",54,"of constantly",54,"going around",54,"in a",54,"circle.",27,"And that",68,"way you",69,"get the",69,"absolute most",69,"out of",69,"everything you",68,"send up",69,"there.",35,"That's",50,"crazy.",50,"You actually",82,"have to",82,"create an",82,"atmosphere, right?",82,"Yes.",100,"It's not like",58,"Earth where it",58,"kind of does",58,"it for us.",58,-1,0,"You actually have",66,"to make it",67,"work.",23,"That's",50,"crazy.",50,"I like",56,"the sabatier",56,"system.",28,"That's",50,"cool.",50,"I like the",59,"energy demonstration.",41,"I thought it was",62,"like part of the",62,"whole thing.",32,"Because I know",63,"they called it",64,"a partially closed",64,"loop because like",64,"you said, you",63,"can inject",70,"the hydrogen",97,"if you",97,"have too",97,"much.",49,"But it's",66,"kind of",66,"the same",66,"concept.",34,"So they",63,"have air,",63,"they have",63,"water, they",64,"have power,",63,"they have",63,"all kinds",63,"of stuff.",64,"So let's",99,"talk about",100,"some of",99,"the experiments.",100,"I",54,"know",54,"one",54,"of",54,"the",54,"biggest",54,"one",54,"is",54,"the",54,"experiment",54,"on",54,"themselves.",54,"In order",57,"to actually",58,"function beyond",57,"low Earth",58,"orbit and",58,"actually function",57,"in space,",58,"you have",63,"to learn",69,"how the",69,"human body",69,"reacts in",69,"space and",69,"what happens.",69,"So I think",73,"the biggest thing,",73,"maybe it's not",74,"the biggest thing,",73,"but it's definitely",74,"a very important",109,"is",61,"bone",60,"loss",61,"and",60,"muscle",61,"degradation,",60,"right?",61,-1,0,"So that",67,"is if",68,"you're in",67,"space for",68,"too long",67,"and you're",68,"just kind",67,"of floating",68,"around, your",68,"bones",51,"start",51,"to",52,"exhibit",51,"symptoms",51,"of",52,"osteoporosis",51,"and",52,"your",51,"muscles",51,"start",52,"to",51,"degrade.",52,"So how",57,"do they",57,"counter that?",58,"Yeah.",100,"Well, when",88,"we talk",88,"research, there's",88,"really, there's",88,"kind of",88,"two different",88,"camps.",44,"There's the",83,"research that",84,"we're doing",84,"on

talking",73,"about.",50,"But there's",67,"the research",68,"that has",68,"direct applications",68,"on Earth",67,"and we",68,"can dive",68,"into that",68,"too.",34,"But that's",97,"research flown",97,"by commercial",97,"companies, by",97,"academia, taking",97,"advantage of",97,"this microgravity",98,"environment because",61,"we've seen",61,"there's a",61,"lot you",61,"can learn",61,"by taking",61,"gravity out",61,"of the",61,"equation.",120,-1,0,"But to",80,"the first",81,"camp, to",80,"the studying",81,"the people,",80,"the astronauts",81,"are guinea",80,"pigs kind",81,"of",54,"thing.",54,"The",53,"human",53,"body",54,"is",53,"an",53,"incredible",54,"machine",53,"and",53,"it's",54,"incredible",53,"at",53,"adapting",54,"to",53,"different",53,"environments.",54,"I mean,",88,"that's both",89,"a gift",89,"and a",89,"curse because",89,"when you",89,"go into",88,"outer space,",89,"I mean,",89,"your vestibular",73,"system, so",58,"your sense",57,"of up",57,"is down,",58,"down is",57,"up, your",58,"balance, all",57,"of that",58,"goes all",54,"out of",54,"whack.",28,"But within",55,"about a",55,"day or",56,"two, most",55,"astronauts don't",56,"have the",55,"nausea anymore.",56,"Their body",70,"is used",71,"to it",70,"already and",71,"they're able",70,"to live",71,"and work,",71,"which that's",70,"incredible.",36,"That's a",66,"great advantage",66,"to just",66,"getting into",66,"a new",66,"environment and",66,"hitting the",65,"ground running.",67,-1,0,"The problem",57,"with that",59,"is when",58,"you get",58,"to an",58,"environment where",58,"you have",58,"gravity again,",58,"hitting the",77,"ground running",77,"can be",77,"very problematic",77,"because your",77,"body, when",77,"it's not,",77,"when gravity",77,"is not pulling",70,"down on you.",70,"So you",56,"and I",57,"right now,",57,"I mean,",57,"gravity is",57,"pushing down",57,"on you",56,"at all",57,"times and",57,"that builds",57,"up muscles",57,"in your",56,"hips and",57,"bones in",57,"your hips.",57,"And that's",67,"why your",67,"legs are",67,"strong enough",67,"to just",67,"hold you",67,"upright because",67,"they're constantly",67,"fighting",55,"against",55,"that",55,"force.",55,"On places",98,"like the",99,"space station,",99,"that force",98,"disappears.",50,"And so",52,"your body",52,"says, \"Hmm,",52,"well, I",53,"don't need",52,"these muscles",52,"anymore.\" So",65,"it stops",78,"feeding nutrients",78,"to those.",78,"And so",88,"you can",88,"actually, astronauts",88,"will dispel,",88,"so in",88,"their urine,",88,"they'll get",88,"raised levels",88,"of calcium",68,"because their",68,"bones aren't",68,"needing it",69,"as much",68,"because their",68,"bones aren't",68,"getting that",83,"much force",98,"just by",97,"existing.",49,-1,0,"They're getting rid",72,"of the calcium",72,"because the body's",71,"saying, \"You don't",73,"need this anymore.\"",72,"And so",74,"understanding a",75,"lot of",74,"those processes",75,"is important",74,"because, I",75,"mean, if",74,"the astronauts",75,"were just",52,"going to",53,"stay in",53,"microgravity forever,",53,"not that",53,"big of",53,"a deal",53,"because their",53,"body just",70,"adapts and",87,"I mean,",86,"they become",87,"space people.",87,"But astronauts",85,"come back",85,"to Earth.",86,"Astronauts will walk",73,"on Mars where",74,"there is gravity,",74,"less gravity, but",73,"still gravity.",50,"And you're going",72,"to need to",72,"walk around in",72,"a pretty heavy",72,"space suit and",72,"things like that.",148,"So finding",73,"ways to",73,"counteract, we",73,"call them",73,"countermeasures for",73,"all the",73,"ways the",73,"body adapts",66,"is, it's",58,"something that",58,"we've been",58,"doing pretty",58,"much as",58,"long as",58,"we've been",58,"doing space",81,"flight,",53,"but",52,"we've",53,"really",53,"aggressively",52,"pursued",53,"it",52,"on",53,"board",53,"the",52,"space",53,"station.",53,-1,0,"So for",82,"example, bone",82,"loss and",82,"muscle loss,",82,"we've actually",82,"pretty much",82,"reversed for",82,"the most",72,"part, all",62,"of the",62,"bone loss",61,"and muscle",62,"loss.",31,"You'll still",60,"see changes",60,"in bone",61,"density in",60,"some of",61,"the crew",60,"members, but",61,"a lot",60,"of them",61,"aren't losing",63,"that bone",64,"mass, that",63,"muscle mass",64,"that was",63,"such a",64,"problem in",63,"early long",64,"duration",70,"space",71,"flight.",71,"And we",66,"do that",67,"through exercise.",67,"That",50,"is",50,"the",51,"main",50,"driver.",51,"There's exercise",92,"and there's",93,"nutrition.",47,"But exercise,",58,"the crew",58,"members are",58,"working out",59,"about two",58,"hours every",58,"single day.",59,"I don't",51,"know about",51,"you, but",51,"I don't",51,"work out",52,"two hours",51,"every single",51,"day.",26,"30 minutes,",75,"I'm pretty",75,"much telling",76,"you.",38,"Even that can",70,"be hard for",71,"some people to",71,"find, but the",70,"crew members, two",71,"hours every single",71,"day",77,"and",77,"that's",77,"exercise,",77,"both",77,"cardio",77,"and",77,"resistance.",77,-1,0,"So they",63,"have a",63,"number of",63,"devices up",63,"there.",32,"They have",61,"a treadmill,",62,"which again,",61,"you need",62,"to remember",61,"everything, and",62,"this is",61,"the running",62,"theme, everything",87,"we do",87,"in microgravity",87,"is different.",87,"So you can't",72,"just hop on",72,"a treadmill, you'll",72,"just float away",72,"and you'll just",72,"be pumping your",79,"legs in",63,"microgravity and",64,"that does",63,"nothing for",63,"you.",32,"So the",72,"treadmill actually",73,"has a",73,"harness with",73,"basically bungee",73,"cables that",72,"pulls them",73,"down towards",92,"the",55,"treadmill.",56,"So that",58,"way you're",58,"getting the",58,"force in",58,"your legs,",58,"you're actually",58,"exerting more",58,"force and",69,"you can",78,"run.",39,"It's the closest",66,"you can get",67,"to just running",66,"in space.",45,"I mean,",58,"we've had",59,"astronauts run",58,"marathons on",59,"the treadmill",58,"and that's",59,"one of",58,"their key",59,"devices.",100,"They also",79,"have something",79,"called the",79,"Advanced Resistive",79,"Exercise Device.",80,"I've stayed",70,"away from",70,"acronyms as",71,"much as",70,"possible so",71,"far, but",70,"they inevitably",70,"come up.",136,-1,0,"We call",72,"it ARED",73,"and it's",72,"basically their",73,"home gym",72,"on board",73,"the station.",73,"Now again,",51,"you can't",51,"just pick",51,"up a",51,"heavy weight",51,"and do",51,"some curls",51,"and get",51,"a workout.",52,"It doesn't work",60,"like that.",40,"Wait, that makes no",57,"sense in microgravity.",43,"Yeah,",50,"there's",51,"microgravity.",51,"So I",66,"mean, they",66,"literally move",66,"several hundred",66,"pound modules",66,"and pieces",66,"of hardware",66,"all the",66,"time.",140,"And so",78,"to help",78,"simulate weightlifting,",78,"it actually",79,"uses a",78,"series of",78,"pneumatic tubes",79,"to",74,"simulate",75,"force.",75,"And they",69,"can actually",70,"simulate up",70,"to 600",70,"pounds of",70,"force.",35,"Which some",66,"of the",66,"astronauts, their",66,"squat number",66,"goes up",66,"when they're",66,"up there",66,"and

I",57,"can do that.",43,"Well, I don't",56,"think any of",56,"them do 600",57,"pounds, but they",56,"have the option",57,"if we ever",56,"get some power",78,"lifters up",80,"on board",80,"the station.",80,-1,0,"And then",69,"they also",68,"have a",70,"stationary bicycle.",69,"And then",59,"there's another",59,"treadmill.",30,"So there's",61,"actually, well,",62,"there's two",62,"treadmills on",62,"board the",62,"station.",31,"But I",69,"mean, they",70,"use all",70,"of those",70,"two hours",70,"a day",70,"just, and",70,"that's just",70,"to maintain",70,"that bone",113,"and",79,"muscle.",79,"And there's",72,"also ways",72,"you can",72,"help that",72,"process through",72,"nutrition.",36,"We're constantly",58,"looking, is",58,"there a",59,"better

for",66,"them to",68,"work out",68,"a lot",68,"harder, but",67,"for a",68,"shorter amount",68,"of time.",68,"High",52,"intensity",52,"interval.",52,"Yeah.",100,"Because two hours",67,"is a long",67,"time every single",67,"day.",23,"Right.",100,"That's a",91,"lot to",91,"ask.",46,"And crew",53,"time is",54,"very valuable,",54,"right?",27,-1,0,"Because they,",57,"I mean,",58,"you're talking",57,"about, like",58,"you said,",57,"200, I",58,"think it's",57,"200 experiments",58,"per increment,",85,"right?",43,"And astronauts",66,"are- 250",96,"is",62,"the",63,"usual",62,"number.",63,"In like",71,"a six",71,"month span,",72,"250 experiments",71,"will happen",72,"on board",71,"the station.",72,"That's",50,"crazy.",50,"So yeah,",68,"crew time",69,"is very",69,"valuable and",68,"that's two",69,"hours gone",69,"every day",68,"from experiment",69,"time just",89,"to",54,"maintain",54,"bone",55,"and",54,"muscle",54,"mass.",55,"Yep.",100,"Wow.",100,"But I",64,"mean, that's",65,"just one",64,"part of",65,"what changes",64,"when you're",65,"in

can't",64,"see.",32,-1,0,"That's a",50,"big issue.",50,"That's a",50,"big one.",50,"And so",68,"we're trying",68,"to figure",69,"out exactly",68,"why

see",56,"anything.",29,"It'd be",94,"kind of",95,"a buzzkill.",95,"Travel 60",68,"million miles",67,"and get",69,"out and",68,"everything's blurry.",67,"Yeah.",100,"That wouldn't",53,"make me",53,"happy.",27,"So I",63,"know like",63,"when, here's",64,"another thing,",63,"when astronauts,",64,"so astronauts",63,"now they're",64,"doing on",69,"the International",70,"Space Station",69,"pretty regularly,",70,"they're doing",69,"long duration",70,"increments, right?",135,-1,0,"So they're",64,"doing six",64,"months at",64,"a time.",64,"So this is",67,"longer than any",67,"of the shuttle",68,"missions or a",67,"lot of the",67,"missions before

they",60,"have a",60,"hard time",60,"walking, right?",60,"When they",80,"first get",80,"out.",40,"Some",50,"do.",50,"And so",96,"that's part",96,"of, again,",96,"the human",97,"body reacting",96,"to the",96,"different environments.",96,"When astronauts",57,"first get",57,"into space,",57,"some will",57,"have nausea,",57,"some will",56,"have some",57,"adverse reactions",72,"to being",87,"in
