all",52,"the folks",52,"that have",52,"the coolest",51,"information, the",52,"stuff you",52,"really want",52,"to know,",52,"right on",52,"the show",52,"and tell",52,"you more",52,"about all",52,"things NASA.",52,"We're talking",52,"everything from",52,"extra to rest",74,"your own dirt",75,"to the unknown",74,"parts of the",75,"universe.",24,"So today on",75,"the first episode",75,"ever we're",68,"talking International",69,"Space Station",68,"with Dan",69,"Hewitt.",34,"He's the",69,"public affairs",68,"officer for",61,"the Space",52,"Station program",52,"here at",52,"the NASA",52,"Johnson Space",53,"Center in",52,"Houston, Texas.",52,"And we",52,"had a",53,"great discussion",57,"about what",57,"the International",58,"Space Station",57,"is, how",58,"it works,",57,"what it's",57,"made of,",58,"and why",54,"it's there.",52,-1,0,"So with",51,"no further",51,"delay, let's",52,"go light",51,"speed and",51,"jump right",52,"ahead to",51,"our talk",52,"with",211,"Mr.",211,"Dan",211,"Hewitt.",211,"Enjoy.",212,"[Music]",1672,"So anyway,",55,"let's begin.",56,"I figured",55,"you're the",56,"perfect person",55,"to have",56,"here being",55,"the public",56,"affairs officer",69,"of the",83,"International Space",82,"Station.",42,"You talk",82,"to scientists,",83,"astronauts, engineers,",83,"constantly.",32,"So you're",65,"very aware",65,"of what's",65,"going on",65,"and everything",65,"about the",65,"space station.",66,-1,0,"So for",54,"those of",55,"you listening,",55,"I think",54,"this is",55,"a good",55,"opportunity to",55,"learn just",54,"everything about",55,"it.",28,"So start",79,"from the",79,"very beginning.",79,"What is",79,"it?",39,"Everything.",40,"Awesome.",39,"Well, to",79,"start in",79,"the beginning.",80,"So the",74,"space station",75,"is it's",75,"a giant",75,"spaceship.",38,"I mean,",75,"it is",75,"the largest",75,"spacecraft that",75,"humans have",75,"ever built.",66,"And we",66,"haven't been",67,"flying in",66,"space for",67,"too long",66,"relatively.",33,"I mean,",67,"we've been",66,"up there",66,"for 50",63,"or 60",60,"years.",30,"But the",59,"space station",60,"is kind",60,"of the",59,"pinnacle for",60,"what we've",60,"built so",59,"far.",30,"It is",60,"massive.",30,"I mean,",71,"this thing",71,"supports multiple",71,"people.",35,"It's been",72,"up there",71,"at least",71,"pieces of",71,"it since",71,"1998.",36,"So that's",66,"another one",67,"of those",66,"factoid alerts",67,"that we",66,"always like",67,"to tell",66,"people.",33,"If you",67,"were born",67,"after the",62,"year 1998,",62,"the spacecraft's",62,"always been",62,"up there.",63,-1,0,"But if",62,"you were",62,"born after",62,"the year,",63,"after November",72,"of 2000,",72,"as long",73,"as you've",72,"been alive,",73,"human beings",72,"have been",72,"living and",73,"working in",72,"space.",36,"Wow.",38,"We are",77,"aliens.",38,"We are",75,"a space-faring",77,"species.",38,"We are",76,"the ones",75,"off the",77,"planet.",38,"We've had",61,"people up",62,"there every",62,"single day",61,"for as",62,"of right",62,"now over",62,"16 years.",61,"I mean,",62,"that is",62,"mind-blowing.",95,-1,0,"And they're",57,"doing stuff",58,"every single",58,"day.",29,"It's either",57,"going to",58,"impact us",58,"here on",58,"Earth or",57,"get us",58,"ready to",58,"go further",58,"out.",26,"I mean,",53,"that is",53,"the purpose",53,"of the",53,"space station.",53,"That's why",54,"it's up",53,"there.",26,"That's why",53,"we have",53,"this huge",54,"thing floating",66,"above us.",67,"So you",67,"say stuff.",67,"We're doing",67,"stuff every",66,"day.",34,"Obviously, living",67,"up there,",67,"I think is",73,"a big part",73,"of it.",49,"Right?",24,"Where we're like",74,"you said, where",73,"explorers, or space",73,"fairs.",25,"What is",50,"the stuff",50,"that's actually,",50,"you know,",50,"that has",50,"that impact?",51,"It's a",50,"lot of",50,"stuff.",25,"It's a",50,"lot of",50,"stuff.",26,"I mean,",57,"it is,",57,"and it's",57,"divided up.",57,"It is,",57,"is simple",57,"as just",58,"living in",57,"space.",28,"So just",57,"everything you",58,"do in",57,"space is",57,"a little",57,"bit different",52,"than the way",72,"you do it",71,"down here on",71,"Earth.",24,"I mean, it",71,"could be anything",71,"from going to",72,"the bathroom to",71,"how you eat",71,"to just how",71,"you get your",72,"water.",24,"Everything's different.",61,-1,0,"So it's",61,"like a",61,"way to",61,"practice really.",62,"It is",61,"for things",61,"further out.",61,"Because it's",61,"not really",62,"far up,",61,"right?",31,"It's only",51,"250 miles.",51,"If you",51,"think about",51,"it, we're",52,"still in",51,"the Earth's",51,"protection.",26,"I mean,",62,"like, oh,",63,"it's so",63,"protected by",63,"the Earth's",63,"magnetic field.",63,"Well, space",63,"is funny",62,"in that",63,"going up.",63,"It feels",63,"like it's",63,"so far",63,"away space.",63,"But it's",67,"250 miles.",68,"That's not",67,"that far.",68,"I mean,",68,"I feel",67,"like the",68,"city of",68,"Houston is",67,"250 miles.",68,"It's not.",68,"But I",69,"mean, 250",69,"miles on",69,"a car",69,"is a",69,"short road",69,"trip.",35,"But 250",69,"miles straight",69,"up, that's",69,"a rocket",69,"ride.",35,"It's a",63,"slightly different",63,"road trip.",63,"But it",64,"isn't that",63,"far away.",63,"I mean,",64,"we still",63,"kind of",63,"are right",64,"in the",63,"doorstep.",32,"There's",59,"a",59,"really",59,"great",60,"quote",59,"in",59,"the,",60,"the,",59,"the",59,"paramount",59,"of",60,"space",59,"movies,",59,"Armageddon,",60,"where",59,"our",59,"own",60,"will says,",52,"you know,",52,"we're not",52,"even out",53,"in outer",52,"space yet.",52,-1,0,"This is",53,"just like",52,"the beginning.",52,"And that's",53,"kind of",52,"where the",52,"station is.",53,"It's in",52,"space.",27,"It's in",52,"what we",53,"call lower",53,"or the",52,"orbit.",26,"So it's",53,"still pretty",53,"close.",26,"I mean,",53,"they could",52,"get in",53,"the, so",55,"you spacecraft",56,"and be",56,"back on",57,"the ground",56,"inside a",56,"couple of",57,"hours.",28,"So I",56,"mean, you're",57,"still right",56,"in the",56,"doorstep.",29,"You're not",58,"really way",58,"out there",59,"yet.",29,"But it's",58,"getting us",58,"ready to",59,"go way",58,"out there.",59,"Well, that's the",70,"whole, so NASA",71,"describes it as",71,"Earth's reliant, right?",71,"So I kind",71,"of like the",71,"way they section",71,"it off.",48,"Right?",29,"Earth's reliant",60,"means exactly",59,"what you",59,"said.",30,"Right?",30,"So if",59,"something goes",60,"wrong, you",62,"can just",65,"hop into",64,"spacecraft and",65,"be home",65,"in three",65,"hours.",32,"And it's",65,"easy to",64,"get stuff",65,"there because",65,"it's only,",65,"I mean,",51,"some Soyuz",51,"rice have",51,"been as",50,"little as",52,"like six",51,"hours, right?",51,"Relatively.",25,"Relatively.",26,"Relatively.",31,"Go into",63,"space.",32,"It's only",63,"rocket science.",63,-1,0,"Don't want",63,"to trivialize.",63,"It's still,",63,"and even",63,"that's even",60,"after it",56,"managed myself.",56,"It's still",57,"not easy",56,"to go",56,"to space.",57,"It's still,",56,"I mean,",56,"it is",57,"rocket science.",56,"It's literal",56,"rocket science.",56,"Right.",36,"Hugely complex.",71,"And there's",72,"always inherent",71,"risk in",71,"all these",71,"other things.",71,"But when",71,"you start",72,"comparing it",71,"to, you",79,"know, going",86,"to Mars",87,"or, you",86,"know, our",87,"far-flung aspirations",87,"of spreading",86,"throughout the",87,"solar system",86,"and the",87,"galaxy and",86,"everything, when",86,"you compare",85,"it to",85,"that, it's,",85,"you know,",85,"doing hand",85,"quotes easy.",85,"But it's",85,"still a",85,"monumental undertaking.",86,"Yeah.",28,"And that's",58,"why.",29,"So we're",58,"doing that.",58,"Just like",58,"you said,",58,"in the",58,"future, we",58,"want to",58,"go farther.",58,"Right?",29,"So we",56,"want to",57,"go to",57,"Mars.",28,"We want",57,"to really",57,"just expand",57,"our presence",56,"in the",57,"solar system.",57,-1,0,"So the",57,"international space",56,"station is",57,"a great",57,"way to",57,"practice that.",57,"It's a",50,"good, like",50,"you have",50,"a good",51,"understanding of",50,"what it",50,"takes to",51,"live in",50,"space.",25,"To operate",50,"in space,",51,"you could",52,"do a",53,"ton of",53,"science and",53,"learn how",53,"things interact.",52,"And then",53,"if you",53,"learn how",53,"things interact,",53,"you can",59,"design better",59,"systems to",59,"make them",59,"work better.",60,"I think",59,"one of",59,"the ones,",59,"I think,",59,"capillary action.",60,"I think",60,"was a",60,"great one.",60,"Like the",61,"way that",60,"fluid's moved",60,"in space",61,"is kind",60,"of cool",60,"because they",61,"sort of",60,"like create",60,"a ball.",61,"And there's",68,"no down.",68,"So if",68,"you're trying",68,"to design",68,"like a",69,"system that,",68,"like a",68,"rocket system",68,"in order",68,"to propel",68,"fuel, you",60,"need to,",51,"the fuel",51,"isn't going",51,"to go",50,"down, right?",51,"You kind",51,"of need",51,"to have",51,"that sort",51,"of capillary",51,"action and",50,"a path",51,"to get",51,"there.",26,"Like little,",52,"those little",52,"tiny things",52,"are things",52,"that make",52,"the huge",53,"difference and",52,"being able",52,"to kind",52,"of exploit",52,"the solar",52,"system.",27,-1,0,"Well it",58,"all comes",59,"to down",59,"to gravity.",58,"And that's",59,"kind of",59,"the ultimate",58,"differentiator between",59,"why everything",59,"we do",58,"in outer",59,"space is",59,"different from",58,"the way",59,"we do",59,"it on",58,"Earth.",30,"Totally.",36,"Some of",74,"the stuff",74,"you touch",74,"on is",73,"very apt.",74,"I mean,",74,"just moving",73,"fluids where,",74,"you know,",74,"here on",74,"Earth, we",73,"almost take",74,"it for",74,"granted, that",65,"everything settles",58,"towards the",58,"bottom.",29,"So plumbing",58,"systems and",57,"everything you",58,"can use",58,"that to",58,"your advantage.",58,"And space,",55,"you don't",55,"have that.",55,"And that",55,"affects everything",55,"from moving",56,"rocket fuel",55,"to, you",55,"know, I'm",55,"an astronaut",55,"and I",55,"need to",56,"get a",55,"drink of",55,"water.",28,"Well, that",85,"system has",85,"to be",86,"specifically designed",85,"to work",85,"in the",86,"absence of",85,"gravity.",43,"Yeah.",30,"And we've",62,"had a",62,"lot of",61,"practice, you",62,"know, since",61,"we've been",62,"flying in",62,"space, since",61,"since the",62,"60s.",31,-1,0,"But the",74,"station is",74,"really the",74,"first place",74,"you've had",74,"on this",74,"scale.",37,"There have",74,"been space",74,"stations in",74,"the past,",74,"both from",74,"the US",74,"and Russia.",75,"But",54,"the",55,"space",54,"station",55,"is",54,"really",55,"the",54,"modern",55,"cutting",54,"edge",55,"test",55,"bed",54,"for",55,"just",54,"doing",55,"and",54,"learning",55,"everything",54,"about",55,"living",54,"in",55,"space.",55,"And so",58,"you have",59,"all of",59,"these different",59,"technologies that,",59,"like I",58,"said earlier,",59,"everything you",59,"do in",59,"space is",59,"different from",59,"the way",58,"that you",59,"do it",59,"on planet",59,"Earth, where,",59,"you know,",59,"you have",86,"oxygen, thanks",87,"to natural",87,"cycles in",87,"the of",87,"trees, scrubbing",87,"carbon dioxide",87,"from your",87,"atmosphere and",87,"producing oxygen",87,"back for",87,"you.",44,"You have",81,"water in",82,"lakes, reservoirs",82,"coming literally",82,"raining down",82,"on you",81,"from the",82,"sky, where",82,"in space,",82,"none of",82,"that exists.",82,-1,0,"Yes, you",62,"either have",63,"to bring",62,"it with",63,"you or",62,"find a",63,"way to",62,"create it.",63,"And that's",64,"something that",65,"we're doing",64,"on the",65,"station right",64,"now, where",65,"you're trying",64,"to, and",65,"that's one",64,"of those",65,"key, we",64,"always talk",65,"about the",64,"different technologies",65,"that you",64,"need.",33,"And technologies",76,"are really",77,"broad and",77,"term.",39,"But one",77,"of the",77,"ones that",77,"is a",76,"lot, probably",77,"easier to",77,"understand is",77,"how we",77,"get those",77,"things, how",69,"you get",60,"the water,",61,"how you",61,"get the",60,"air just",61,"for the",60,"crew members.",61,"And one",61,"of the",60,"things you",61,"got to",60,"remember is,",61,"again, so",61,"we're close",60,"to Earth",61,"right now.",61,"So we",63,"can launch",63,"water, we",63,"can launch",63,"air, we",63,"can launch",63,"all these",64,"things to",63,"these crew",63,"members.",32,"But when",68,"they go",69,"to Mars,",69,"there's no",69,"resupply ship.",68,-1,0,"There's no,",69,"you know,",69,"hey, the",69,"water tanks",68,"get low,",69,"let's stop",69,"off here",69,"and tap",68,"it off.",69,"You can't",69,"do that.",69,"So you",55,"got to",56,"bring everything",56,"with you",56,"and everything",56,"is heavy.",55,"So the",56,"more stuff",56,"you bring",56,"with you,",56,"the more",55,"fuel you",56,"need, the",56,"more expensive",56,"you're mission,",56,"and it",56,"just kind",55,"of compounds",56,"on and",56,"on and",56,"on and",56,"on.",28,"And I'm going",64,"to ramble here",64,"for a while,",64,"because I'd love",65,"this subject.",43,"Okay, well, I'll",71,"kind of, I'm",71,"not going to",72,"stop you.",47,"I'm going to",72,"kind of read,",71,"like read, vert",72,"you.",24,"Okay, one",58,"of the",58,"things on",58,"the international",58,"space station",58,"they're doing",58,"now to",58,"do exactly",58,"that.",29,"So we",58,"used to",58,"things are",58,"heavy, right?",58,"Water, water,",58,"especially is",58,"very heavy.",59,"Yes.",26,"I forget",54,"the cost",53,"per pound",53,"to order",54,"in order",53,"to launch.",53,"Always varies.",54,"Always varies.",69,"Okay, that's",69,"good to",69,"know.",35,"But I",69,"know the",69,"one way",70,"they're actually",69,"doing, like",69,"helping that",69,"out for",69,"long duration",70,"missions is",69,"recycling.",35,-1,0,"And the",60,"recycling system",60,"is just",60,"top notch.",60,"So good",60,"that they",60,"actually brought",60,"the technology",60,"back down",60,"to earth",60,"and then",60,"actually helping",60,"out third",60,"world countries",60,"with, you",60,"know, not",60,"access to",60,"any kind",60,"of clean",60,"drinking water.",60,"It's like",54,"the filtration",55,"system is",54,"that good.",55,"They drink",54,"their own",55,"urine and",54,"you capture",55,"sweat and",54,"stuff like",55,"that, right?",55,"They do.",80,"And that's,",80,"that's always",80,"a fun,",80,"ill moment.",80,"A little",66,"kids and",67,"stuff when",67,"you tell",66,"them that.",67,"But there's",67,"the famous",66,"astronaut saying",67,"that yesterday's",67,"coffee is",66,"tomorrow's coffee",67,"to where",67,"that's what",66,"you

Earth.",58,"And",50,"actually",50,"the",50,"same",50,"pressure",50,"too.",50,-1,0,"So",50,"there's",50,"no",50,"big",50,"difference",50,"there.",50,"That feeds",50,"into some",50,"of the",50,"stuff that",50,"you do",50,"for spacewalks.",50,"But that's",80,"completely different",80,"tangent.",40,"I can",50,"go on.",50,"But",57,"so",57,"we",57,"split",57,"the",57,"water",57,"molecules.",58,"So then",50,"you have",50,"your oxygen",50,"which you",50,"can just",50,"feed directly",50,"back into",50,"the cabin.",50,"And then",80,"you have",80,"hydrogen which",80,"you can",80,"vent overboard.",80,"If you",63,"just build",63,"up a",63,"bunch of",63,"excess hydrogen",63,"or there's",63,"a process",64,"in a",63,"payload up",63,"there.",32,"It's used.",75,"It's more",75,"of a",75,"technology demonstration.",75,"So it's",75,"not really",75,"in the",75,"critical path.",75,"So it's not",60,"a critical piece",60,"that we have",60,"to have running",60,"it all times.",60,"But it's",80,"called the",80,"sabotea.",40,"It uses",73,"the sabotea",74,"process where",74,"you can",73,"take that",74,"hydrogen that",74,"you had",73,"left over",74,"from your",74,"water.",37,-1,0,"And then",63,"you can",63,"take the",63,"carbon dioxide",63,"that gets",63,"scrubbed out",63,"of the",64,"atmosphere by",63,"a different",63,"device.",32,"You split",80,"that carbon",80,"dioxide.",40,"You now",72,"have oxygen",73,"and then",73,"you have",72,"your leftover",73,"hydrogen.",37,"You combine those",66,"two and you",67,"have more water.",67,"And so",80,"you can",80,"kind of",80,"build the",80,"ideal is",80,"to build",80,"a closed",80,"loop.",40,"So",50,"everything",50,"that",50,"gets",50,"put",50,"into",50,"this",50,"life",50,"support",50,"loop.",50,"It's",50,"a",50,"big",50,"circle.",50,"Just constantly",75,"gets recycled.",75,"You got",75,"your water.",75,"You drink",75,"your water.",75,"You recycle",75,"your water.",75,"You take some",69,"of that water.",69,"You turn it",69,"into air and",69,"oxygen.",24,"You take",60,"that excess",60,"hydrogen.",30,"You combine",60,"it with",60,"CO2.",30,"The astronauts",66,"are breathing",67,"out.",33,"You make",67,"more water.",67,"And so it's",69,"all just kind",69,"of constantly going",69,"around in a",69,"circle.",24,-1,0,"And that",71,"way you",71,"get the",72,"absolute most",71,"of everything",72,"you've sent",71,"up there.",72,"That's crazy.",88,"You actually",89,"have to",89,"create an",89,"atmosphere.",45,"It's not",66,"like earth",67,"where it",67,"kind of",66,"does it",67,"for us.",67,"You actually",57,"have to",57,"make it",57,"work.",29,"That's",50,"crazy.",50,"I like the",60,"symbiotia system.",40,"That's clearly",66,"says it's",67,"technology demonstration.",67,"I thought it",63,"was part of",63,"a whole thing",63,"because I know",63,"they call it",63,"a partially closed",63,"loop.",22,"Because like you",64,"said you can",64,"eject the hydrogen",64,"if you have",65,"too much.",43,"But",80,"it's",80,"the",80,"same",80,"concept.",80,"So",50,"they",50,"have",50,"air,",50,"water,",50,"power,",50,"all",50,"kinds",50,"of",50,"stuff.",50,"So",50,"let's",50,"talk",50,"about",50,"some",50,"of",50,"the",50,"experiments.",50,"I know",83,"one of",83,"the biggest",84,"one is",83,"the experiment",83,"on themselves.",84,"So in",80,"order to",80,"actually function",80,"beyond lower",80,"th orbit",80,"and actually",80,"function in",80,"space, you",75,"have to",72,"learn how",71,"the human",72,"body reacts",71,"in space",71,"and what",72,"happens.",36,-1,0,"So I",50,"think the",50,"biggest thing,",50,"maybe it's",50,"not the",50,"biggest thing.",50,"But it's",83,"definitely a",83,"very important",84,"is bone",83,"loss and",83,"muscle degradation.",84,"So that",70,"is if",71,"you're in",70,"space for",71,"too long",70,"and you're",71,"just kind",71,"of floating",70,"around, your",86,"bones",50,"start",50,"to",50,"exhibit",50,"symptoms",50,"of",50,"osteoporosis",50,"and",50,"your",50,"muscle",50,"start",50,"to",50,"degrade.",50,"So how",66,"do they",67,"counter that?",67,"Yeah.",100,"Well when",76,"we talk",77,"research, there's",77,"really there's",77,"kind of",77,"two different",77,"camps.",39,"There's the",84,"research that",84,"we're doing",84,"on

were",53,"just talking",52,"about.",27,"Then there's",80,"the research",80,"that has",80,"direct applications",80,"on earth.",80,-1,0,"And we",87,"can dive",88,"into that",87,"too, but",88,"that's research",87,"flown by",88,"commercial companies",87,"by academia,",88,"taking advantage",72,"of this",73,"microgravity environment",73,"because we've",72,"seen there's",73,"a lot",73,"you can",73,"learn by",72,"taking gravity",73,"out of",73,"the equation.",73,"But to",88,"the first",89,"camp, to",89,"the studying",89,"the people,",89,"the astronauts",89,"are guinea",89,"pigs kind",89,"of thing.",89,"The",53,"human",53,"body",54,"is",53,"an",53,"incredible",54,"machine",53,"and",53,"it's",54,"incredible",53,"at",53,"adapting",54,"to",53,"different",53,"environments.",54,"I",50,"mean,",50,"that's",50,"both",50,"a",50,"gifted",50,"curse",50,"because",50,"when",50,"you",50,"go",50,"into",50,"outer",50,"space,",50,"you're your",60,"vestibular system,",61,"so your",61,"sense of",61,"up is",61,"down, down,",61,"is up,",61,"your balance,",60,"all that",61,"goes all",61,"out of",61,"whack.",31,-1,0,"But within",66,"about a",67,"day or",67,"two, most",66,"astronauts don't",67,"have the",67,"nausea anymore,",66,"their body",67,"is used",67,"to it",66,"already, and",64,"they're able",60,"to live",60,"and work,",60,"which that's",60,"incredible.",30,"That's a",62,"great advantage",63,"to just",62,"getting into",63,"a new",62,"environment and",63,"hitting the",62,"ground running.",63,"The problem",60,"with that",60,"is when",60,"you get",60,"to an",60,"environment where",60,"you have",60,"gravity again,",60,"hitting the",60,"ground running,",60,"can be",77,"very problematic",78,"because your",78,"body, when",78,"it's not,",77,"when gravity",78,"is not",78,"pulling down",78,"on you.",78,"So you",53,"and I",53,"right now,",54,"I mean,",53,"gravity is",53,"pushing down",54,"on you",53,"at all",53,"times, and",54,"that builds",53,"up muscles",53,"in your",54,"hips and",53,"bones in",53,"your hips.",54,"And that's",70,"why your",70,"legs are",70,"strong enough",70,"to just",70,"hold you",70,"upright because",70,"they're constantly",70,"fighting against",70,"that force.",70,"On places",80,"like the",80,"space station,",80,"that force",80,"disappears, and",80,"so your",80,"body says,",80,"\"I don't",80,"need these",80,"muscles anymore,",80,"so it",85,"stops feeding",86,"nutrients to",86,"those.\" And",81,"so you",77,"can actually",77,"astronauts will",77,"dispel, so",77,"in their",77,"urine they'll",77,"get raised",76,"levels of",77,"calcium because",77,"their bones",77,"aren't needing",77,"it as",77,"much, because",84,"their bones",91,"aren't getting",91,"that much",91,"force just",91,"by existing.",91,-1,0,"They're getting rid",63,"of the calcium",63,"because you're getting",63,"it doesn't, the",63,"body saying, \"You",63,"don't need this",63,"anymore.\" And",54,"so understanding",64,"that a",64,"lot of",64,"those processes",64,"is important",64,"because, I",64,"mean, if",64,"the astronauts",64,"were just",64,"going to",64,"stay in",64,"microgravity forever,",64,"not that",63,"big of",63,"a deal",63,"because they're",63,"probably just",63,"the daps",63,"and they",64,"mean they",63,"become space",63,"people.",32,"But astronauts",70,"come back",70,"to Earth,",70,"astronauts will",70,"walk on",70,"Mars where",70,"there is",70,"gravity, less",70,"gravity, but",70,"still gravity.",70,"And you're going",66,"to need to",67,"walk around in",67,"a pretty heavy",66,"space suit and",67,"things like that.",67,"So finding",90,"ways to",90,"counteract, to",90,"countermeasures for",90,"all the",90,"ways the",90,"body adapts",90,"is something",90,"that we've",90,"been doing,",90,"pretty much",76,"as long",76,"as we've",76,"been doing",76,"space flight,",76,"but we've",77,"really aggressively",76,"pursued it",76,"on board",76,"the space",76,"station.",39,-1,0,"So for",80,"example, bone",80,"loss and",80,"muscle loss,",80,"we've actually",80,"pretty much",80,"reversed for",80,"the most",80,"part, all",80,"of the",80,"bone loss",80,"and muscle",80,"loss.",40,"You'll see",64,"changes in",64,"bone density",64,"in some",64,"of the",64,"crew members,",64,"but a",64,"lot of",64,"them aren't",64,"losing that",64,"bone mass,",64,"that muscle",64,"mass, that",68,"was such",73,"a problem",72,"in early",73,"long duration",73,"space flight.",73,"And we",82,"do that",83,"to exercise,",83,"that is",83,"the main",82,"driver exercise",83,"and there's",83,"nutrition, but",83,"exercise, the",82,"crew members",83,"are working",83,"out about",83,"two hours",82,"every single",83,"day.",42,"I don't",53,"know about",53,"you, but",54,"I don't",53,"work out",53,"two hours",54,"every single",53,"day.",27,"Thirty minutes,",57,"I'm pretty",57,"much telling",57,"you.",29,"Even that",52,"can be",53,"hard for",52,"some people",53,"to find,",53,"but the",52,"crew members,",53,"two hours",53,"every single",52,"day.",27,-1,0,"And",50,"that's",50,"exercise",50,"both",50,"cardio",50,"and",50,"resistance.",50,"So",50,"they",50,"have",50,"a",50,"number",50,"of",50,"devices",50,"up",50,"there.",50,"They have",70,"a treadmill,",71,"which again,",70,"you need",71,"to remember",70,"everything and",71,"this is",71,"the running",70,"theme.",36,"Everything we",63,"do in",63,"microgravity is",63,"different.",32,"So you",63,"can't just",63,"hop on",63,"a treadmill.",63,"You'll just",63,"float away.",64,"And you'll",53,"just be",53,"pumping your",54,"legs and",53,"microgravity and",53,"that does",54,"nothing for",53,"you.",27,"So the",77,"treadmill actually",78,"has a",78,"harness with",78,"basically bungee",77,"cables that",78,"pulls them",78,"down towards",78,"the treadmill.",78,"So that",63,"way you're",63,"getting the",63,"force and",63,"your legs,",63,"you're actually",63,"exerting more",64,"force and",63,"you can",63,"run.",32,"It's closer you",60,"can get to",60,"just running in",60,"space.",20,"And we've",75,"had astronauts",75,"run marathons",75,"on the",75,"treadmill and",75,"that's one",75,"of their",75,"key devices.",75,-1,0,"They also",80,"have something",80,"called the",80,"advanced resistive",80,"exercise device.",80,"I've stayed away",66,"from acronyms as",67,"much as possible.",67,"You do",58,"not regret",59,"just so",59,"far, but",59,"they inevitably",59,"come up.",58,"We call",59,"it a",59,"red.",30,"And it",61,"is, it's",62,"there.",30,"It's basically",62,"their home",61,"gym onboard",62,"the station.",62,"Now again,",50,"you can't",50,"just pick",50,"up a",50,"heavy weight",50,"and do",50,"some curls",50,"and you",50,"know get",50,"a workout.",50,"We don't work.",60,"It makes no",60,"sense.",20,"It's a grand-go-gravity.",60,"Yeah.",33,"There's microgravity.",67,"So I",66,"mean, they",67,"can literally",67,"move several",66,"hundred pound",67,"modules and",67,"pieces of",66,"hardware all",67,"the time.",67,"And so",94,"to help",94,"simulate weightlifting,",94,"it actually",94,"uses a",94,"series of",94,"pneumatic tubes",94,"to simulate",94,"force.",48,"And they",72,"can actually",73,"simulate up",73,"to 600",72,"pounds of",73,"force.",37,"Nice.",29,"Which, some",59,"of the",59,"astronauts, they're",58,"squat, their",59,"squat number",59,"goes up",59,"when they're",59,"up there.",59,-1,0,"And it's",55,"slightly misleading",56,"because they're",55,"not squatting",56,"their own",55,"body weight",56,"like they",55,"are here",56,"on earth.",56,"Right.",30,"It's still",62,"600 pounds.",61,"I don't",62,"think I",61,"can do",62,"600 pounds.",62,"But they",63,"have the",63,"option if",63,"we ever",63,"get some",63,"power lifters",63,"one day",64,"up on",63,"board the",63,"station.",32,"And then",61,"they also",62,"have a",61,"stationary bicycle.",62,"And then",61,"there's another",62,"treadmill.",31,"So there's",54,"actually, well,",55,"there's two",54,"treadmills on",55,"board the",54,"station.",28,"But I",78,"mean, they",78,"use all",78,"of those",79,"two hours",78,"a day",78,"just and",78,"that's just",79,"a main",78,"team that",78,"bone and",78,"muscle.",40,"And there's",66,"also ways",67,"you can",67,"help that",66,"process through",67,"nutrition or",67,"constantly looking,",66,"is there",67,"a better",67,"way for",66,"them to",67,"work out?",67,"Should they",69,"do?",35,"I mean,",69,"there's something",70,"there are",70,"research projects",69,"like sprint",70,"where does",69,"it make",70,"sense for",69,"them to",70,"work out?",70,-1,0,"A lot",60,"harder, but",60,"for a",60,"shorter amount",60,"of time.",60,"Like",50,"high",50,"intensity.",50,"Yeah.",50,"Yeah.",33,"Because two",67,"hours is",66,"a long",67,"time every",67,"single day.",66,"Right.",34,"That's a lot",60,"to ask.",40,"And but",57,"so.",28,"And crew",57,"time is",58,"very valuable,",57,"right?",28,"Because they,",57,"I mean,",58,"you're talking",57,"about, like",57,"you said,",57,"200.",29,"I think",77,"it's 200",78,"experiments per",78,"increment, right?",78,"And astronaut",77,"250 is",78,"the usual",78,"is the",78,"usual number.",78,"And like",66,"her six",67,"months span.",67,"250 experiments",75,"will happen",75,"on board",75,"the station.",75,"That's crazy.",78,"So yeah,",78,"crew time",78,"is very",79,"valuable.",39,"And that's",78,"two hours",78,"gone every",78,"day from",79,"experiment time",78,"just to",78,"maintain both",79,"bone",60,"and",60,"muscle",60,"mass.",60,"Yeah.",60,"Wow.",100,"But I",71,"mean, that's",71,"just one",72,"part of",71,"what changes",72,"when you're",71,"in microgravity.",72,-1,0,"I mean,",55,"there, you're,",56,"your body",55,"actually has",56,"less blood",55,"in it",56,"by the",55,"time you",56,"come home.",56,"Your heart",66,"can change",67,"sizes because",67,"it

that's",87,"something that",88,"we knew",88,"about, but",87,"it was",88,"never really",88,"considered a",88,"huge deal,",87,"not a",88,"huge deal,",88,"but never",87,"really considered",88,"a major",88,"impact until",88,"within the",87,"last couple",88,"of years",88,"when we",87,"had a",88,"significant amount",88,"of astronauts",88,"returning from",87,"these really",88,"long stays",88,"in

a",60,"little while,",60,"but for",60,"these crew",59,"members the",61,"vision never",60,"got better.",60,-1,0,"Well,",50,"that's",50,"a",50,"concern.",50,"If you",56,"send somebody",56,"to Mars",56,"in the",55,"nine months",57,"or however",56,"long it",56,"ends up",56,"taking to",56,"get there,",56,"all of",56,"a sudden",55,"they go",57,"from 2020",56,"to needing",56,"glasses to",56,"needing even",56,"stronger glasses",56,"that they",56,"don't have",55,"available and",57,"they land",56,"on Mars",56,"and they",56,"can't see.",56,"That's",50,"a",50,"big",50,"issue.",50,"And

on",70,"the international",70,"space station",69,"pretty regularly",71,"they're doing",70,"long duration",70,"increments, right?",70,"So they're",50,"doing six",50,"months at",50,"a time.",50,"Yes.",100,"So this",55,"is longer",56,"than any",55,"of the",56,"shuttle missions",55,"or a",56,"lot of",55,"the missions",56,"before
